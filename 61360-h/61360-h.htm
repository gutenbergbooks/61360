<h2>Pronouncing Gaelic</h2>

<i>sh</i>; <i>th</i>, <i>bh</i>, <i>dh</i>, and <i>gh</i> are sometimes (but not always)
silent; <i>mh</i> is usually pronounced <i>v</i>; and <i>ch</i> has a sound not
found in English at all, and made by trying to say <i>kh</i> as
far back in the throat as possible.</p>

<h2>Historical Note</h2>

<p>To avoid confusion I have in this book described clan
tartans more or less as they exist today. This is not strictly
accurate. To begin with, in 1644 clans had not yet adopted
specific tartans to be worn by all their members, and probably
none of the tartans were the same, in either pattern
or color, as they are today. In fact, it is very difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
know just what they did look like, for all kinds of vegetable
dyes were used, and the remnants of old tartans
that we find today are so faded and changed in color that
they seem mostly gray or gray-brown, and it is hard to tell
what colors they once were.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_1">1. The Gypsies</h2>

<p>The people of Inverness were deeply annoyed. A number
of them stood in the square and scowled with
great hostility at the three tattered wanderers in their
midst—but their anger held a wary quality.</p>

<p>“Tinklers! Gypsies!” they cried accusingly, and the soft,
sibilant sound of the Gaelic was less soft but more sibilant
than usual. “<i lang="gd">Briosag!</i>” (“Witch!”) muttered some with
conviction but caution. “Thieves!” they added, getting to
the real heart of the annoyance. And with this fresh reminder
of their grievances they began picking up stones
as they advanced toward the man, woman, and girl.</p>

<p>Anyone who expected to see clan loyalty in this gypsy
family would have been terribly disappointed. The massive
bent shoulders and stringy legs of the man somehow
evaporated between two houses, and the final glance from
his pasty dark face was one of hooded derision.</p>

<p>Old Mina Faw didn’t seem at all put out by her man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
desertion. One might have thought she had expected it.
Her scrawny figure seemed to grow taller as she turned a
once-handsome hag face toward the crowd, and her
sunken pale eyes flashed. The crowd hesitated. Everyone
knew Old Mina was a witch, with the most devastating
Evil Eye in all Scotland.</p>

<p>But surprisingly Mina chose to pacify them. After all,
there weren’t many towns in the Highlands in this year of
1644, and it was well not to be alienating those few too
deeply. “Och, now!” She wheedled the crowd in her thin
but powerful voice. “Ye wouldn’t be wishing to harm a
poor old woman, now, would ye?”</p>

<p>It wasn’t at all that they weren’t wishing to harm her.
But no one wanted to risk having his hands fall off or his
cattle die. They regarded her dubiously, making up their
minds. “Witch!” repeated someone from the safety of the
back. “Thief!” cried several more with fresh indignation,
and they began to move forward again.</p>

<p>“Thief?” echoed Mina indignantly. “Not I! I would only
be reading your palms and telling good fortune for ye. If
anyone has been lifting your belongings, it must be my
wicked wee Kelpie, whom I am beating every night for
her sins.” And she pointed accusingly at an undersized
goblin-lass who might have been perhaps fifteen or seventeen
years old, dressed in an outrageous assortment of
faded scraps. Long black elf-locks flapped about her thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
face and down her back. Eyes that were not quite canny
peered out like those of an alarmed wee beast—or a witch.</p>

<p>The “wicked wee Kelpie” didn’t stay to dispute the
issue. With one bright, mutinous glance at Mina, she dived
through the startled fringe of the crowd like a young stoat
and ran away into the narrow steep lanes of the town.</p>

<p>The Inverness crowd promptly forgot Mina and took
after the lass. “Thief!” they yelled with new enthusiasm.
And whatever was convenient to pick up, they threw.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Kelpie was experienced in this
sort of thing, for it was a nasty chase, and she knew all
too well what might happen if they caught her. With
cunning amounting to sheer genius she ran and dodged,
doubled back and forth between houses, wriggled over
and under and around obstacles. Now and then her intense
small face broke into a pointed grin of appreciation
at her own cleverness—for there was something exhilarating
in outwitting an entire town—but very real fear lurked
behind those uncanny blue eyes. To tell the truth, it was
the tide of ill will surging behind her which oppressed her
even more than the stones. But Kelpie did not realize this,
for she was so used to ill will that she could not remember
anything else.</p>

<p>As for Mina’s deplorable behavior, Kelpie was annoyed
but not in the least astonished. Mina had merely followed
the law of self-preservation, the only law Kelpie knew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
She herself would do the same thing, given the chance. It
was the only way to stay alive.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Briosag!</i> Witch!”</p>

<p>Kelpie swerved round a corner and wished that she
<em>were</em> a witch. If so, she wouldn’t be running now but putting
a braw spell on them all, causing their legs to buckle
under them and stay that way for three days too, so that
the whole town would be crawling about on hands and
knees, just—She laughed at the picture and took another
corner at full speed. Just wait until she <em>was</em> a witch! Och,
no one would chase her then, or beat her, either....</p>

<p>A red petticoat spread on a gorse bush vanished magically
as she flew past. Why not? If she got away, she was
a petticoat richer. If not, what would it be mattering, a
petticoat more, since she already had two stolen purses, a
kerchief, and a fine <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> on her anyhow?</p>

<p>Up hill and down and around, and finally away out of
the town, and presently the stones ceased to bite at her
ankles and back, and the yells were lost behind. Her
breath seared her lungs now, and she hurtled down the
hill toward the river which led from Loch Ness to Moray
Firth. At last she threw herself into a cold, wet, but safely
thick bank of broom, bracken, and juniper, where she lay
panting and gasping painfully. Mina and Bogle would be
safely away by now and waiting for her down along the
path that was the only road along Loch Ness. Let them
wait. She had earned a rest. She was sore bruised and aching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
from the stones, and her bare feet, tough as they were,
hurt from the cobbled streets of the town.</p>

<p>Och, she thought pleasantly, if only they would some
day be catching and hanging Mina, and Bogle too—but
only, of course, after Kelpie had learned all the witchcraft
that Mina knew, and perhaps more. Oh, to be a more
powerful witch than Mina, and to be putting all kinds of
curses on her until all scores were settled!</p>

<p>Curled up in her nest of bracken, head resting on the
scarlet petticoat, Kelpie drifted into her favorite daydream.
<i lang="gd">Dhé</i>, how Mina would plead for mercy! Her arms
and legs would shrivel up, just, and her few remaining
teeth fall out. Kelpie smiled, looking like a starry-eyed lass
dreaming of romance. Then her short upper lip curled and
lifted, revealing a row of small, sharp white teeth, so that
she looked more like a wolf cub dreaming of dinner.</p>

<p>The long northern twilight was beginning to creep into
the Great Glen, for sunlight vanished early in the valley
between those high, steep, massive hills, even in March.
She must go on now, or she would be beaten for delaying.
And presently, still sore, she was loping silently down the
path by the loch, where new gorse and bracken grew between
patches of old snow. Two or three miles down she
met Bogle and Mina sitting on their bundles and waiting.</p>

<p>“You have taken your time about getting here,” said
Bogle. “And how many purses were you taking?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Twilight had deepened into the toneless half-light of
gloaming. Light had slowly drained from the Glen, leaving
a world of eerie gray on the hill above Loch Ness. The
loch itself was liquid iron, from which might easily arise
the three black humps and snaky neck of the <i lang="gd">each uisghe</i>,
the water horse who lived there. A meager supper was
over, and the only color left in the world was the small
salmon-pink pennant of cloud flying over the black shoulder
of Meall Fuarvounie and reflected in the shining
crystal ball in Mina’s hand.</p>

<p>She spread a shabby bit of stolen black velvet on the
springy turf and set the crystal sphere lovingly in the exact
center. “And now you will be reading the glass with me,”
she said.</p>

<p>It was a nightly ritual. Ordinarily Kelpie found it interesting,
exciting, but tonight she was sore and aching and
rebellion was in her. It was foolish, of course, to express
such feelings. It was to risk not only a beating—which,
being used to, she did not fear—but an evil spell, which
she did. But she expressed them now and then, all the
same.</p>

<p>“May the <i lang="gd">uruisg</i> be away with you!” she said sweetly
and ducked. Mina’s fist merely caught the top of Kelpie’s
tangled head, but her snarl was more effective.</p>

<p>“Mind me so!” Her voice rasped. “And how do you
think to be learning witchcraft else?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am reading the crystal with you every night,” muttered
Kelpie. “But you’ll never let me be trying alone, and
you’ve taught me never so much as a single wee spell.”</p>

<p>“And listen to her now!” The hateful voice was a croak
of derision, echoed by a snort from the bulky gray shadow
that was Bogle. “She cannot crawl yet and she is wanting
to run!” And this time the blow fell on Kelpie’s high, thin
cheekbone before she could think to duck. “Look into the
crystal, <i lang="gd">amadain</i>!”</p>

<p>Kelpie considered further defiance and then decided
against it. She didn’t really feel up to another beating tonight,
and she did want to learn witchcraft. So she permitted
Mina’s long gnarled hand to clutch her own so that
Kelpie would be able to see what Mina did. For a seer
could share his sight with another by touching him, and
Kelpie, said Mina, was not yet ready to see alone. Night
after night, for as long as she could remember, Kelpie had
looked into the ball with Mina, describing what she saw,
while the old woman questioned and corrected her.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mina, and Kelpie stared into the luminous
ball. First it clouded, then the center began to glow dully,
and then a vague picture developed. Kelpie’s dark head
bent forward on its long neck, and her eyes grew wide
and fixed....</p>

<p>Two young men were riding along a loch-side on fine
horses, with a blond giant behind them on a shaggy Highland
pony. Bright tartan <i lang="gd">filleadh mór</i>—the bulky great-kilts—beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
heavily against their thighs and swung over
their shoulders, and their heads were high with the proud
confidence of the well-born.</p>

<p>Kelpie recognized one of them. Young Glenfern, it was,
whose father was a minor chieftain of Clan Cameron, and
who had once given her a farthing and a sudden compassionate
smile that lit his grave dark-eyed face like sunshine.
The smile had roused in Kelpie a strange sensation
of joy and resentment combined, and the feeling came
back now as she stared. There was gladness behind the
composure of his face as he rode, and his dark shoulder-length
hair lifted in the breeze. And Kelpie, ignorant of
the eternal attraction of lad for lass, frowned at the pleasant
pain of her own feelings. She spared no more than a
glance for the other young man in MacDonald tartan,
whose narrow face seemed composed of straight lines,
whose freckles matched the blaze of his red hair, whose
expression seemed to laugh at all the world.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” muttered Mina, peering. “What will
they be to us? Do you know them?”</p>

<p>“No,” lied Kelpie, whose policy was to deceive Mina
and Bogle whenever possible, just on principle.</p>

<p>“I would be seeing something of the King, or the war,
or Mac Cailein Mor,” said Mina fretfully.</p>

<p>Kelpie spared her a narrow, speculative glance. Why
was Mina so interested of late in politics? Of what benefit
to her was the blaze of civil war sweeping through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
remote world of England and even the less remote world
of the Lowlands? As far as Kelpie could see, it affected
them not at all—except, of course, that Mac Cailein Mor,
Marquis of Argyll, Chief of Clan Campbell, was head of
the Covenant army of the Lowlands and therefore a
merciless hunter of witches. But then Mac Cailein Mor
came into these Western Highlands only now and then,
and merely to wipe out here and there a few of the clans
whom he had always hated. A terrible fierce enemy he
was, no doubt, and one deserving the Evil Eye—but
what was he to Mina, at all?</p>

<p>“Is it still the lads riding, then?” Mina persisted. “And
who will they be, whatever?”</p>

<p>Always and always Kelpie must describe every detail,
just as if Mina couldn’t see for herself. Kelpie was irritated.
“How should I be knowing?” she snapped, and a
blow on the ear set her head ringing.</p>

<p>“Don’t know! <i lang="gd">Amadain!</i> What tartan will they be wearing?”</p>

<p>It was too much. Kelpie jerked away, too angry to care
about the consequences. “<i lang="gd">Nathrach!</i>” She spat. “Look for
yourself!”</p>

<p>The motionless gray bulk in the shadows now stirred
and gave a low, spiteful chuckle. “She cannot,” Bogle
said, wheezing with satisfaction. “It is sure I am now; her
Sight will be going from her. It was for that, these long
years ago, that she must be stealing a wee bairn with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ringed eyes of the Second Sight, and holding her hand so
that she can see through other eyes what she cannot see
for herself—”</p>

<p>There was a scream of fury from old Mina, and a battered
saucepan hurtled through the dusk, hit Bogle’s
ragged shoulder, and fell into the heather. Bogle chuckled
with malicious triumph. It wasn’t that he hated Mina in
particular. He was quite impartial, was Bogle; he simply
hated all mankind and greatly enjoyed seeing anyone unhappy.
Now he ducked his head slightly and shook with
laughter as the saucepan was followed by an assortment
of sticks, stolen objects, and curses.</p>

<p>Kelpie sat perfectly still. A universe of startling possibilities
was opening to her mind—because, with Mina’s
hand no longer touching hers, the tiny picture in the
crystal glowed more sharply, brightly clear than she had
ever seen it.</p>

<p class="tb">Wrapped in her tattered plaidie in a nest of last year’s
dry bracken, she lay awake after the long gloaming had
deepened to black and stars peeped out to grow dim again
as the unearthly white radiance of the northern lights—the
Dancers—shimmered and pulsed over the western
hills. The wonder of the lights, as Kelpie watched, seemed
to match the wonder in her heart.</p>

<p>Had Bogle told the truth? Mina’s behavior made Kelpie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
think he had. And it was certain that the crystal was even
clearer for her without Mina’s touch.</p>

<p>So then, was it also true that she had been stolen? From
where? Kelpie reached back into her memory but could
find nothing but the vagrant life of gypsies—tramping,
begging, stealing, telling fortunes and selling spells and
charms in the Highlands, running from witch-hunters in
the Lowlands, sleeping under the sky.</p>

<p>Och, how could she ever be finding out? Only, perhaps,
by becoming a greater witch than Mina and putting the
power upon her. And indeed, it was a great advantage if
Mina no longer had the Sight! <i lang="gd">Dhé</i>, but she had other
powers, had Mina, terrible powers of cursing and spells!
She was clever, too, and for all her age she used a stick
with great strength. Kelpie must be canny, she must so.
The cold streams of the northern lights faded, and when
they were gone, Kelpie was asleep.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_2">2. The Waif</h2>

<p>It was one of those days that couldn’t decide between
winter and spring. A cold, gusty wind whistled thinly
through dark pine and barren birch and chased fat clouds
over the sky one by one, causing flurries of hard rain to
alternate with pale and hesitant sunshine.</p>

<p>They had traveled the thirty miles of Loch Ness, stopping
at the village near Urquhart Castle, and again at
Kilcummin, where they had nearly been caught picking
the purse of one of the MacDonald chieftains. And now
they were moving south beside the silver ripples of Loch
Lochy.</p>

<p>Kelpie was far ahead of Mina and Bogle, moving along
high on the hillside with a prancing motion caused partly
by high spirits and partly by the masses of tough-stemmed
heather that covered the slope. She was still sore from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
latest beating, and also hungry. Her life consisted largely
of pain and hunger and cold, and was peopled by enemies
to be feared and hated or fools to be tricked, but Kelpie
had discovered all that long ago and was quite used to the
fact and found life very enjoyable anyway. Certainly it
was never dull, and she had a zest for adventure.</p>

<p>And in spite of everything, the world was beautiful.
Kelpie could forgive it a lot for that. In any case, her day
was coming! She had deliberately described the details in
last night’s crystal quite wrongly, and Mina hadn’t known.</p>

<p>Or had she?</p>

<p>This appalling thought caused Kelpie to miss her usually
sure footing and to step right in the middle of a gorse
bush. Neither the travel-hardened toughness of the bare
brown foot nor the deceptive beauty of the silvery leaves
saved her from a good pricking, and Kelpie swore with
an ardent fluency that would have pleased Bogle greatly.
Still hopping and cursing, she saw the movement and
color of the three horsemen down the loch much later
than she should have. They were coming along toward
her in the path below and doubtless had well-filled purses
which might well be lightened. She was halfway down
the steep slope when suddenly the sun shone brightly
from behind the latest cloud, and Kelpie recognized the
scene from the crystal: young Glenfern and his red-haired
companion and the giant blond <i lang="gd">ghillie</i> riding behind.</p>

<p>But there was no time to wonder about it. Timing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
movements carefully, Kelpie threw herself headlong down
the last steep bank and sprawled full length in the path,
almost under the horses’ feet.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” exclaimed Ian Cameron as he and Alex reined
the horses so sharply that they reared for a moment on
their hind legs. All he could see on the ground was a pitifully
small and tattered figure, clearly in great danger of
being trampled to death.</p>

<p>Alex MacDonald, from his better position behind, saw
something a little more. As Ian’s horse stepped alarmingly
close to Kelpie, one “thin and helpless” arm moved, neatly
and efficiently, the precise six inches required for safety.
Alex’s red eyebrows arched, and an appreciative grin
danced on his face. He relaxed and prepared to enjoy the
comedy that was sure to follow.</p>

<p>The crisis was over in a moment. “Is it all right you
are?” demanded Ian of the wee figure, and the wee figure
nodded biting its lip in a fine imitation of silent courage
as it raised itself painfully to an elbow. For Kelpie had
discovered that this sort of act was much more touching
than loud wails and tears. She decided to have a hurt
back, this being hard to disprove, as well as more impressive
than other hurts. So she winced to indicate great pain
and looked up with a brave and pathetic smile.</p>

<p>The lads looked back at her. A scrawny waif it was,
tattered and unbelievably dirty. The tangled dark hair,
apparently never touched by water or comb, fell over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
thin face in a way that reminded Ian of shaggy Highland
cattle—except that these eyes were unlike those of any
cattle that ever lived. They were long and black-fringed,
set at a slant in the narrow face, and strangely ringed.
Around each black pupil was a wide circle of smoky blue,
then a narrow one of lightish gray, and a third of deep
and vivid blue. Astonishing eyes, almost alarming! Where
had he seen them before?</p>

<p>While Ian stared in wonder and pity, Alex made a few
further observations of his own. He noted the high cheekbones
and the pointed chin and the wicked slant of black
brows and the short upper lip—giving rather the effect,
thought Alex, of a wicked elfin creature, or perhaps a
witch. Amused but wary, he sat back and let his foster
brother make up his mind. Ian wouldn’t have been noticing,
of course, that the wee <i lang="gd">briosag</i> threw herself into the
path on purpose. Ian had the way of always believing the
best of everyone.</p>

<p>Ian was aware of the cynical smile behind him. A nasty
suspicious mind Alex had! It was a pity. What else could
he be expecting of a poor wild waif like this? What sort
of life must she have had? Then Ian remembered where
he had seen her before: with that wicked old witch Mina.
Och, the poor creature!</p>

<p>“’Tis hurt you are,” he said worriedly, to Kelpie’s relief.
She had feared for a moment that she’d been too
subtle altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Och, only a little,” she whispered, putting on a braw
show of dreadful pain heroically borne.</p>

<p>“Now, do not be overdoing it,” drawled Alex.</p>

<p>Kelpie shot him a look which, had she been a properly
qualified witch, would surely have caused him to break
out with every loathsome disease known to mankind. Unfortunately
the only effect of her venomous glare was that
Alex’s smile broadened to an insulting chuckle. Och, what
a beast he was, then, with the bony, freckled, jeering face
of him, and the two jaunty tufts of red hair jutting upward
just where horns ought to sprout! She was about to
tell him so, and in great detail, but just in time she remembered
her role and Ian, who was still showing his
pity and dismay.</p>

<p>What a misfortune, he thought, that this should happen
now, just when he and Alex were nearly home again after
those long months away in Oxford, where he had been
savagely homesick. They were about to get home early,
and with very important news, and now this had to happen,
not five miles from Glenfern.</p>

<p>“What shall we be doing with you at all?” he said. “We
cannot just be leaving her here!” he added fiercely, turning
on Lachlan, the blond <i lang="gd">ghillie</i>, who, looking larger
than usual on his short shaggy pony, had muttered something
from behind.</p>

<p>“Give her a copper,” Alex said, laughing, “and see how
quickly she’ll mend!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Copper indeed! thought Kelpie. It was silver she was
wanting. But she didn’t hide the gleam in her eyes quickly
enough.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” said Alex. Slowly, tantalizingly, he drew
a coin from his sporran and held it up. It gleamed silver,
and Kelpie stared at it greedily. “See?” Alex chuckled
and spun it toward her.</p>

<p>Quick as the flash of bright metal in the air, her brown
hand shot out to catch it in flight—then dropped, and the
coin fell noiselessly on the path. Kelpie sat staring first at
it and then at her own shoulder with dismay that was, for
a change, perfectly genuine.</p>

<p>“I—I <em>am</em> hurt!” she said with astonishment and then
hastily snatched up the coin with her good left hand before
they should change their minds.</p>

<p>“Not too hurt to be picking up the silver,” observed
Alex, but the gibe lacked his earlier light tone. Ian had
already dismounted and was touching rather gingerly the
filthy rags covering the shoulder in question. The lass
frankly stank.</p>

<p>This time Kelpie’s face showed an honest flicker of pain.
“I think it will be sprained, or perhaps out of place,” Ian
decided and looked at Alex.</p>

<p>Alex looked back at him. “Well, so. And where does she
live, then? Where are her people? Perhaps Lachlan could
be taking her home.”</p>

<p>Ian shrugged. “I think I’ve seen her with Old Mina and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Black Bogle. Is that so?” he asked Kelpie, who nodded.</p>

<p>Alex raised his eyebrows, not in the least surprised. It
was logical that she should belong to the nastiest witch in
Scotland.</p>

<p>“Will they be coming along, then?” Ian inquired, and
again Kelpie nodded, so bewildered by her unexpected
hurt and the pain that was now shooting sharply through
her shoulder that she couldn’t really think clearly at all.</p>

<p>A glum silence settled on them, broken only by furtive
and disapproving mutters from Lachlan. His duty was to
be protecting his young masters, and now here they were
consorting with witches, and he not able to prevent them
at all, at all. He crossed himself.</p>

<p>Ian sighed with relief when the bent figures of Mina and
Bogle appeared up the loch-side. They would take care of
their lass, and he and Alex could be away home.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t that easy. Mina, after taking in the situation
at a glance, burst into lamentations and curses that
caused the ruddy Lachlan to go pale. “And is it our poor
lass you have harmed, wicked beasts that you are?” she
wailed, while Bogle stood like a massive old tree in disconcerting
silence. “Ocho, ocho, whatever shall we be
doing now? May the Evil Eye fall on all your cattle, and
the pox upon yourselves, <i lang="gd">uruisgean</i> that you are!”</p>

<p>Ian himself recoiled, not from the curses, but from the
evil that was in this horrible old woman. What a dreadful
thing that a young lass should belong to such as these! It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was wicked! And yet, what could he do? What could anyone
do? Unhappily he stood and stroked his horse’s nose
while Alex handled the matter.</p>

<p>Alex did handle it beautifully, with just the right mixture
of indulgence, severity, and money. “’Twas no fault
of ours that she fell, but altogether her own,” he told
them. “Still, we are kind-hearted and willing to give you
a bit of silver.” And when Mina would have demanded
more, he fixed her with a stern hazel stare that caused her
own pale, muddy eyes to waver and fall. It was all settled
then, and Ian, feeling depressed, turned to mount his
horse.</p>

<p>And then Black Bogle, perhaps feeling that they had
been worsted in the bargaining, reached down and jerked
Kelpie roughly to her feet by the injured arm.</p>

<p>The bit of brutality wrenched a choked cry of anguish
from the girl. Ian whirled around, and Alex was off his
horse in a flying leap and seized Bogle’s arm in a grip that
had no gentleness whatever.</p>

<p>“Let go of her, you vile bully!” Alex snarled, red with
fury, while Ian removed the sagging Kelpie from Bogle’s
grasp. Lachlan, brandishing a steel dirk a foot long, loomed
ominously behind....</p>

<p>When Kelpie was again able to take an active interest
in events, she heard several voices: a cold, contemptuous
one and a dangerously quiet one, Bogle’s growl and Mina’s
whine, with dour grumblings in the background. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
money changed hands, and then Mina bent over Kelpie,
a cunning, complacent look on her face.</p>

<p>“The fine gentlemen will be taking you home with them
to fix your hurt, and we will come to fetch you in the
morning,” she said. “You will be properly grateful—and
behave as I’d be wishing you to,” she added meaningly,
and Kelpie nodded. She knew quite well what Mina meant—steal
whatever she could lay hands on.</p>

<p>Then Ian’s concerned face was close to hers as he removed
the grimy once-red sash from about her waist and
gently bound the injured arm to her side. “And who’s
knowing what further damage the brute will have done?”
he muttered.</p>

<p>After that she found herself lifted to the fearful height
of Alex’s horse and felt his hard young arm firmly around
her. And at a slow walk they set along toward the fork
in the path that led through the hills to Glenfern.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the top of the pass, Kelpie
was feeling much better. She began to relish the adventure,
and she stared with interest at the scene before her
as they paused. Ian’s face was alight with joy, and Lachlan
actually had tears in his eyes. A strange thing that was,
she thought wonderingly, ignorant as she was of the love
of the Highlander for his own hills. Kelpie knew no home
but the ground she walked on.</p>

<p>The glen ran westward ahead of them, a long little
valley cradled in hills that were just turning jewel-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
with new bracken and showing dark with juniper and
white here and there with birch trunks and unmelted
snow. On the northern slope stood a weathered gray house
which seemed large and grand indeed to Kelpie, and
scattered along the glen were little rye-thatched shieling
huts of unmortared stone, nestled into the hillside as if
they had grown there. Farther down the glen was a wee
loch of silver and blue, ringed with white birches and
dotted with green islets.</p>

<p>“Loch nan Eilean—Lake of the Islands,” murmured
Ian with his heart in his voice, and they rode on down
the hill and along to the stables.</p>

<p>Alex lifted Kelpie down from the horse, looked at her
oddly, and then with a grin forced open her left hand.</p>

<p>“You little devil!” He laughed. “You’ve picked my
pocket!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_3">3. Glenfern</h2>

<p>Kelpie perched gingerly on a fine brocaded chair near
the door of the drawing room and gazed curiously
at the scene before her. For house and glen had, on their
arrival, erupted into a perfect frenzy of excitement, questions,
tears, laughter, shouting, teasing, and hugging.</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> And was this the way most families were behaving
toward one another? Kelpie found it baffling and achingly
strange, and vaguely annoying; and on the whole she was
glad enough to have been forgotten for the moment while
she recovered her usual cool head.</p>

<p>Talk rose and surged in a mixture of Gaelic and English.
Cameron of Glenfern paced back and forth, the rusty-red
and green of his kilt swinging about strong knees. Lady
Glenfern, smiling and anxious at once, sat in a carved oak
chair, her harebell-blue skirts billowing about her feet.
Two small kilted lads pranced with excitement, a bittie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
lass clamored to be away up in Ian’s arms, and a bonnie
lass in green, perhaps near Kelpie’s age, clung affectionately
to both Ian and Alex at once.</p>

<p>Through the open window Kelpie could see Lachlan
standing in a ring of laughing and chattering clansmen,
and it began to dawn on her that this was no ordinary
homecoming. The lads had been away to school in a far-off
place in England and had returned quite unexpectedly
with important news.</p>

<p>“We knew that King Charles had fled London and set
up his court at Oxford,” said Glenfern. “And you wrote
that Montrose was there, awaiting permission to come and
raise an army in Scotland for the King. Now you say he’s
coming?”</p>

<p>“Aye so,” said Alex cynically, “but a bit late, now that
Argyll has got all the Lowlands and some of the Highlands
well under the thumb of the cursed Covenant! Were you
knowing that the Covenant army has crossed the border
into England and will be fighting along with the Parliament
army against the King?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” exclaimed Glenfern in dismay. “Is it too late,
then? Why was the King waiting so long?”</p>

<p>Alex shrugged. “Och, King Charles has a grand talent
for not seeing what he doesn’t like, and for doing the
wrong thing altogether or the right thing too late.”</p>

<p>Ian, whose loyalty was a simple and wholehearted
thing, frowned at his foster brother. “He’s our king and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a Stewart,” he reminded him and then turned to his father.
“At any rate, we were thinking we’d best come home while
we still could—and perhaps join Montrose when he
arrives.”</p>

<p>None of this meant a great deal to Kelpie, so she began
looking around with greedy wonder at the drawing room.
Och, the glowing fine old silver on the sideboard, the
great portraits on the tapestry-hung walls, the grand,
massive carved furniture worn smooth as silk by time and
polish, and the damask draperies at real glass windows!
It wasn’t fair that some people should have so much! They
should be sharing it, they should, and it was up to Kelpie,
she felt, to see to the sharing.</p>

<p>A small silver snuff box was lying on a table near her;
an instant later, it wasn’t. Kelpie’s long slanted eyes
flickered with satisfaction, but before she could so much
as thrust her loot under her rags, a redheaded figure bent
over her and a sinewy long hand grasped her wrist gently
but with great strength.</p>

<p>“Really, Ian,” observed Alex lazily, “you must be paying
more attention to your guest.”</p>

<p>“Ssssss!” said Kelpie, again wishing she could cast the
Evil Eye on him. But instead the eyes of the entire family
were now on her.</p>

<p>“My sorrow!” said Ian ruefully. “I was forgetting!”</p>

<p>“A shame to all of us, and she injured!” declared his
mother, standing up. “’Tis only for the night, you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
saying, Ian? Well, so, we will see to the shoulder—but not
in the house, I think,” she added, looking at Kelpie’s filthy
clothes.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed her husband. “Come away out to the wee
room in the stable, which will do nicely, I think.”</p>

<p>And Kelpie, who had expected to be beaten and turned
out for her theft, stared. They were daft, all of them! But
presently she forgot their daftness because of the surprisingly
painful business of having her shoulder tended.
She gritted her teeth and cursed vigorously, and after it
was over she was glad enough to lie down on the small cot
in the stable-room and be left alone to sleep.</p>

<p class="tb">Kelpie awoke with an oppressive sense of being trapped.
Blindly hostile walls and ceiling surrounded her, shutting
out sky and wind. In sudden panic she would have leaped
up and fled to the safety of outside, but the first movement
brought the sharp, forgotten pain of her shoulder. She
gasped slightly, blinked, and noticed a pair of dark eyes
regarding her from a flower face. It was the wee bit of a
lassie she had seen in the big house, who stood watching
Kelpie with grave sympathy. She was a tiny thing, her
body slight as it rose from the primrose bulk of her long
skirts, but Kelpie was disconcerted. The gaze seemed to
understand too much.</p>

<p>“Poor lady!” said the mite, shaking her honey-brown
head sorrowfully. “Is it a sore bad hurt, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Kelpie said nothing.</p>

<p>Light danced into the dark eyes. “Wee Mairi will kiss
it and make it well.” Quite undeterred by thoughts of
cleanliness, the child leaned over the cot and dropped a
soft kiss on the bandages covering Kelpie’s shoulder, and
then another on her cheek. “Now it will stop hurting,
just, and you can be happy,” she announced. Crooking a
small finger in the old gesture of calling down a blessing
from heaven, she turned and trotted out, leaving a shaken
Kelpie behind her.</p>

<p>Nothing like this had ever happened to her before!
Children had always clung to their mothers, frightened
of the witch’s lass. No one at all had ever kissed her and
Kelpie, to her dismay, found that her eyes had filled with
tears. Och, this would never do at all! She must be hard
and strong, or else how would she ever survive in the
world she knew? She closed her treacherous eyes and
concentrated on subduing the weakness.</p>

<p>The weakness was just about subdued when she became
aware of more company in the room. This time it was a
pair of seven or eight-year-old lads with penetrating
blue eyes set in identical tanned faces which were alight
with passionate curiosity.</p>

<p>Kelpie, still shaken and very much on the defensive
from her encounter with Wee Mairi, glared at them with
frank hostility. They went on staring at her with unwavering
interest. <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> They were nearly as disconcerting as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Wee Mairi—and there were two of them. Kelpie decided
to take the offensive.</p>

<p>“Ssssss!” she hissed, baring her teeth and beetling her
thick eyebrows menacingly. The bright eyes rounded
slightly, but with increased curiosity rather than alarm.</p>

<p>“Were you crying?” asked one boy candidly.</p>

<p>“Are you a witch?” demanded the other.</p>

<p>Kelpie considered. It wasn’t in the least safe to be
thought a witch. It could lead to all sorts of uncomfortable
and fatal things. On the other hand, she had never known
real safety in any case, and it would be pleasant to impress,
or even frighten, these complacent lads.</p>

<p>“I am so,” she said with an intimidating scowl. “I can
put curses on ye, or the Evil Eye whatever.”</p>

<p>They were unintimidated. “Show us!” suggested one
hopefully.</p>

<p>“Alex was saying you cannot,” challenged the other.</p>

<p>“Och, just you wait!” said Kelpie darkly. “I will be
fixing that Alex as ever was!”</p>

<p>“What will you do to him?” persisted the skeptic with
morbid curiosity.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked his twin.</p>

<p>“Kelpie!” said she in triumph, and at last she had impressed
them. For every Highland child knew that a
Kelpie was a kind of fairy person, a water witch who wails
at night by lochs and rivers for a victim, or cries for admittance
at shuttered windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said the skeptical twin, but he said
it halfheartedly.</p>

<p>“Ronald! Donald!” The green-frocked lass who was
Kelpie’s age stood in the doorway, with a big-boned young
woman behind her carrying a tray. “Och, naughty lads!
Ye shouldn’t be bothering in here, and well ye know
it!”</p>

<p>“She’s a witch, and a kelpie too,” reported one of them,
unabashed.</p>

<p>“At least she says so, but we haven’t seen her put a
spell yet,” added the other. “When will you be showing
us one?”</p>

<p>The young woman nearly dropped her tray as she hastily
tried to make the sign of the cross. Her young mistress
looked faintly alarmed but stood her ground. “Be away,
now,” she told the twins. “I’ll take that, Fiona.” She took
the tray from the quaking Fiona and set it on a stool beside
Kelpie’s cot.</p>

<p>“We thought you’d be waking up hungry,” she said and
then looked at Kelpie apologetically, as if ashamed of her
own good fortune and pretty clothes. “My name is Eithne,”
she added, pronouncing it “Ay-na,” with the Highland
lilt in her voice. “And the twins must not be saying such
things—about your being a witch, I mean. Are you?” she
asked, overcome by curiosity.</p>

<p>Kelpie already had hand and mouth full of cold venison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pie and new-baked bannocks and had no intention of
risking the rest of the food. She shook her head firmly and
put on her most innocent and helpless expression.</p>

<p>“Och, no!” she mumbled truthfully around her bannock.
“Not I!”</p>

<p>At this moment a gaunt black cat sidled through the
open door, spat at Fiona, and with a joyful yowl leaped
right on top of Kelpie. This was unfortunate, since black
cats were known to have a fondness for witches.</p>

<p>Fiona backed up to the door, crossing herself furiously,
and Eithne looked awed. “<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” she whispered. “Dubh
has never done that before for anyone!”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked at Dubh with a mixture of pleasure and
irritation. She liked cats, but this one had timed his appearance
poorly.</p>

<p>Dubh looked back at her, great topaz eyes glowing into
hers steadily and inscrutably, and his purring filled the
room.</p>

<p>“He is wanting some food,” suggested Kelpie lamely.
But Dubh didn’t show the slightest interest in her meal.
Instead, he arranged himself comfortably on top of her
legs.</p>

<p>“Animals are always liking me,” Kelpie went on with
better success. Eithne’s face brightened and cleared. Of
course! And if animals liked a person, it was a sure sign
that the person was to be trusted. Eithne, like her brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
wanted to think the best of everyone, especially of those
whom life seemed to have treated unfairly. Besides, Kelpie
interested her.</p>

<p>Presently she was seated on the edge of the cot, listening
to the lurid tale of Kelpie’s life and even being shown
some of the scars and bruises on the thin shoulders and
back. Eithne was hot and shaking with shocked indignation.
It was perfectly dreadful, appalling!</p>

<p>And Kelpie, rising to great tragic heights, played up
to the most sympathetic audience she had ever had. The
long ringed eyes fixed on Eithne’s brown ones were soft
and luminous and oh, so innocent.</p>

<p>But the “innocent” eyes reminded Alex of Dubh’s,
as he entered the room and got a good view of both pairs.
He hadn’t been easy in his mind about Eithne’s being in
here so long. Ringed eyes like that weren’t canny. The
lass might well be a witch, at that, though likely too
young to be very dangerous. All the same, his foster
sister must be protected.</p>

<p>“Come away from her and out of here!” he ordered
Eithne brusquely.</p>

<p>He should have known better. She whirled on him,
round chin jutting out indignantly. “And will you be judging
her unfairly, like all the villagers and all?” Eithne
demanded. “Don’t deny it, Alex MacDonald! You’re thinking
hard, suspicious things about her this very minute!”</p>

<p>Alex’s sunburned face looked disconcerted at this sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
attack, but only for an instant. “Oh, aye,” he agreed
cheerfully. “I am that. And why wouldn’t I be, with the
many reasons she’s given me already? Has she put a spell
on you, <i lang="gd">m’eudail</i>? Best be away to the house and see if
Catriona can break it.”</p>

<p>Eithne stamped her foot, but it wasn’t easy to find a
retort. “You—you talk like a Covenanter!” she finally
flung at him scathingly and flounced out in a swirl of
petticoats, Fiona behind her.</p>

<p>Alex scratched his red head, more confounded by her
passion than by her rather shaky logic. He grinned wryly
at Kelpie, who looked back at him in triumph.</p>

<p>“Poor innocent waif!” he jeered, putting one foot up on
the edge of the cot, where Dubh spat at it. He rested an
elbow on his kilted knee and stared at Kelpie with interest.
She stared back through slitted eyes.</p>

<p>“Before you’re up and away again,” he said, casually,
“I’ve a wee word to be saying to you, and it is this. Unlike
Ian and Eithne, I’ve a nasty suspicious mind, I have.”
He wagged his head sadly. “And I’ve a picture in my head
of you away off tomorrow bearing every movable thing in
the glen hid in your rags, and we sitting here without so
much as a stick of furniture left to us.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, and I would never be doing such a thing!”
cried Kelpie indignantly. “How could I be carrying it
all?”</p>

<p>Alex laughed outright. Kelpie scowled. She had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cursed and beaten often enough, but she had never before
been laughed at, and she didn’t like it.</p>

<p>Alex stopped laughing and grinned at her. “Well, so,
and I’ve a soft heart in me, so I’ll be doing nothing about
such matters as pocket-picking or a certain snuff box, nor
will anyone else, I think. But”—and he leaned forward a
little—“should anything else just happen to be missing
when you leave, then you’ll be finding the hand of every
Cameron and MacDonald, all through the Great Glen and
Lochaber from Loch Leven to Loch Ness, turned against
you.”</p>

<p>Kelpie showed sharp white teeth in a defiant laugh.
“Are you thinking I’ve never heard threats before?”</p>

<p>“Aye, I’m sure you have, and most unpleasant ones,”
retorted Alex. “But have you ever had one like this carried
out, and two entire clans arrayed against you, and every
<i lang="gd">ghillie</i> on the watch?”</p>

<p>Kelpie narrowed her eyes. He had her, just! And to have
the Great Glen and Lochaber closed against them would
be a sore handicap indeed.</p>

<p>“Sssss!” said Kelpie with deep sincerity.</p>

<p>Alex grinned again. “I’m not done,” he said briskly. “It
seems that my foster sister has given you her friendship.
You’re not deserving it, of course, but for Eithne that’s
good enough reason for giving it. Now, I am fond of
Eithne, and if you should be taking advantage of her or
hurting her in any way, I shall see to it that you are punished—even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
if I must denounce you as a witch. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>It was a fearful threat, and Kelpie, used to bluster and
invective, was unnerved by his very calm.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Nathrach!</i>” She spat “Remember, witches can curse!
Shall I be putting the Evil Eye on you?” And she widened
her slanted eyes until the dark and light rings were smoldering
circles.</p>

<p>Alex laughed again, infuriatingly. “And if you haven’t
already put the Evil Eye on me at least three times today,
it must be that you have not got it at all. For you’ve
wanted to, haven’t you? No, I’ll wager you cannot do it.”</p>

<p>“Mina can,” muttered Kelpie sulkily.</p>

<p>“Now that I’ll believe,” he agreed readily. “But even
the Evil Eye wouldn’t save the two of you from being
burned as witches, would it?”</p>

<p>Och, and he was so sure of himself! Kelpie saw suddenly
that great cunning and apparent submission were her best
weapons. “And if I am keeping the bargain?” she hinted,
looking at his pocket.</p>

<p>“We’ve no bargain.” Alex corrected her mildly. “I’m no
such fool. It’s just that I’ve been telling you in a friendly
way what will happen if you should be stealing anything
or hurting Eithne, that’s all.” And he sauntered out, his
kilt swinging jauntily about his brown knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_4">4. The Daft Folk</h2>

<p>Kelpie slept heavily for the first part of the night and
then awoke to stare restlessly into the stifling,
closed-in darkness. How could a body tell the hour, shut
in like this? She must be out into the free air and waiting
when Mina and Bogle came for her.</p>

<p>She got up and groped her way out into the warm, horse-scented
main part of the stable. Dubh, a blacker shape in
the dark, came and wove himself around her ankles as
she felt for the door with her good left hand; her right
shoulder was still too sore to move.</p>

<p>And then she was outside in the cold sweet air of pre-dawn.
The hills to the southeast stood black against a
thin ghost of gray in the sky, and the glen was filled with
a toneless purple except for the ropes of pearly mist strung
down the clefts of the hills and over the loch. A tiny
burn and waterfall danced in a white thread at the far end
of the glen, and the wind smelled of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Kelpie drew in her breath deeply, and the beauty of it
made a sore ache inside her and a daft desire to cry. It
was something deep within her, just, that had these
strange feelings now and then, and she must be careful
never to let them out.</p>

<p>It was these daft folk at Glenfern who were making her
feel peculiar. She must be away from them, away from the
trapping walls and alien people, to the freedom of the hills
and sky. She slipped like a wraith around to the back of the
stable, where the ground sloped upward, wrapping her
bare ankles in the wetness of rank grass and heather and
stinging nettles, which she had long ago stopped noticing.
And at the upper corner a long skinny arm reached out
with the swiftness of a snake, seized Kelpie’s wrist (fortunately,
the uninjured one), and shook her.</p>

<p>“We’ve been waiting for you this long while!” Mina
began pulling her up the hill.</p>

<p>Kelpie came willingly enough. She was almost glad to
see Mina’s evil old face. She knew where she was with
Mina. She could hate and be hated single-mindedly, and
always know how Mina would behave. The people at
Glenfern were unpredictable and confusing.</p>

<p>Black Bogle was waiting in a clump of snowy-trunked
birches halfway up the hill. He said nothing, just grinned
without warmth or welcome.</p>

<p>“Well, and what have you got?” demanded Mina, turning
upon Kelpie with greedy fingers held out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” muttered Kelpie defensively. “The
red-haired <i lang="gd">uruisg</i> took back the silver and the snuff box
and said if I was taking anything else he would be setting
all the Camerons and MacDonalds against us.”</p>

<p>Mina cursed Alex and Kelpie both, but with her mind
so clearly upon other matters that Kelpie didn’t feel the
curses would be very effective. “Well, so!” concluded the
old woman suddenly. “And just as well, perhaps. For we
are wanting you to bide here for a time.”</p>

<p>Kelpie stared, her mouth drooping open. <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> Now
Mina was being as unpredictable as anyone in the glen
below! “And whatever for, if I cannot be stealing anything?”
she demanded. “And why would they be letting
me stay?”</p>

<p>Mina struck at her. Kelpie ducked automatically, and
Bogle chuckled. He would also have chuckled had the
blow landed.</p>

<p>“You’ll be persuading them, just,” commanded Mina.
“Play upon their sympathy. Let them be making you a
maidservant if they will—and mind that you be a good
one. ’Tis a spy you’ll be, to watch and listen, for the lads
are fresh from England and knowing about affairs. Be
learning how they feel about the King and Mac Cailein
Mor and the Lord Graham of Montrose. And keep them
feeling kindly toward you, for we may use them one day.”</p>

<p>Kelpie hooded her eyes thoughtfully. She had already
learned a good bit—but why tell Mina now? Better to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
wait and see where her own advantage lay and learn
what Mina was up to.</p>

<p>“And where will ye be going?” she ventured to ask.</p>

<p>“Never you mind!” snapped Mina. “We will be returning
for you when we are ready, and then it may be that
you can learn some of the witchcraft you are wanting so
badly.” Beneath their wrinkled lids her faded old eyes
gleamed at Kelpie watchfully.</p>

<p>Kelpie kept her own eyes veiled. She knew how much
Mina’s promise was worth, but here was hope that Mina
might really be going to teach her at last, for her own
profit. Kelpie must be very docile, then, and never let
Mina suspect what was in her mind.</p>

<p>“Very well so,” she agreed indifferently, it being best
to show neither reluctance nor enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Once more with the crystal, then,” ordered Mina, producing
it; and Kelpie obediently sat down in the dew-heavy
clumps of long grass. Her face was lowered meekly,
to conceal the knowledge that Mina depended on her to
see the picture. The gray light was now growing rosy over
the bare top of Meall Dubh. The rosiness was reflected
in the shining ball and then moved and scattered.</p>

<p>“A battle!” whispered Kelpie, her eyes large and fixed
on the scene. But it wasn’t like the other battles she had
seen in the crystal—no cavalry charge of armored men
on green slopes, but a charge of Highlanders on the
steeper, wilder hills of Scotland. She could clearly make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
out the bright tartans, and the double-handed claymores
flashing, and she could almost hear the wailing skirl of
the pipes. There was a red-bearded giant in the thick
of it, and a slight brown-haired man on a horse, wearing
a blue bonnet, and it was he who seemed to be the power
behind the charge—though Kelpie couldn’t say how she
knew. And now the others were fleeing in the fury of
the attack, and it seemed to Kelpie that she saw the blue
and green Campbell tartan among the defeated.</p>

<p>Her voice muted and hurried, Kelpie described the
scene to Mina, leaving out the name of the tartan and
any other details that she guessed Mina might not be able
to make out for herself.</p>

<p>And now there was a different scene, and there was the
brown-haired man, dressed quite unfittingly as a groom,
clasping the hand of the red-bearded one, who was looking
altogether astonished and overjoyed, and behind them,
on the hillside, was a cheering crowd of Highlanders.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Mina.</p>

<p>Kelpie shook her head. “A hillside and a crowd of
people,” she murmured, “but ’tis all cloudy.” And then
she held her breath.</p>

<p>But Mina didn’t seem to know that Kelpie was deceiving
her. “I wanted news of Argyll,” she grumbled and put
the crystal away. Then, after a parting cuff, she strode up
the hill with Bogle—and not so much as a parting glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
from either of them. Och, they had some pressing purpose,
the two of them, and whatever could it be?</p>

<p>The eastern sky was apricot now. The sun would be up
in a few minutes, and already golden light was pouring
across the very tops of the hills on the far side of the
glen, but a fitful wind was coming from the west, promising
to bring rain clouds over those same bright hills....</p>

<p>What if, after all, Glenfern refused to let her stay?
Feeling excited and forlorn at once, Kelpie turned her
back on the sunrise and walked slowly down the hill.</p>

<p class="tb">She approached the house on lagging feet, suddenly
nervous. Ian’s father was outside the door, talking to
Lachlan and an old man. Lachlan already disliked her,
and Glenfern looked as if he could be stern indeed. Kelpie
drooped her mouth into an expression of wistful apology,
arranged the sling on her arm so that it showed up well,
and hovered tentatively a few feet away.</p>

<p>Glenfern’s face was kindly enough when he looked up
and saw her. “Good morning,” he greeted her. “And how
are you feeling?”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” replied Kelpie, “and well enough,”—making
it sound like a brave lie. “But—” She stopped,
looking frightened. “Mina and Bogle came,” she began,
and paused.</p>

<p>“Oh. And you’ll be wanting a bit of breakfast before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
you’re away off with them?” suggested Glenfern with a
smile.</p>

<p>“They’re away off without me,” blurted Kelpie, looking
helpless. “They’re not wanting me any more.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” said Glenfern. He didn’t seem overjoyed.</p>

<p>“I have nowhere to go,” added Kelpie pathetically, in
case he hadn’t got the point.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Glenfern, who had got it very quickly.
“Well, come away in, and we’ll see my wife.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Mise-an-dhui!</i>” said Lady Glenfern when they told her.
She looked even less delighted than her husband.</p>

<p>Eithne looked up from sorting and polishing silver. “Och,
what a wicked thing!” she exclaimed, her creamy oval
face troubled and sympathetic. “And have you no other
relations?”</p>

<p>Kelpie shook her head. Wee Mairi, gathering that something
was wrong, ran over and slipped her warm little
hand into Kelpie’s, and the twins looked up in surprise,
for they had thought everyone had more relations than
could be counted.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she had better be staying with us,” they suggested
through mouthfuls of buttered scone—an extra
breakfast, no doubt. “She could put the Evil Eye on all
our enemies, whatever,” added Ronald hopefully.</p>

<p>“You’re not really a witch, are you?” asked Lady Glenfern
seriously. A white witch, of course, was a great benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to have around, since all her powers were used for good;
and the Kirk of the Lowlands had not yet reached far
enough into the Highlands to make even white powers
dangerous. Still, the lass of Old Mina was more likely to
be a black witch, than a white one.</p>

<p>“No!” Said Kelpie vehemently, and with perfect truth.
(How she wished she were!) “And I would never be
wanting to harm anyone,” she added, less truthfully.</p>

<p>Alex, sitting cross-legged on the far window seat, sent
her a bright hazel glance of derision, which Kelpie ignored.</p>

<p>Glenfern raised an eyebrow at his wife, sighed, and
smiled kindly. “Would you be wanting to stay with us,
lassie?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I would so,” replied Kelpie forthrightly. This was easier
than she had hoped—if only Alex didn’t spoil it. “I could
be working,” she offered meekly. “’Tis little enough I am
knowing about the insides of houses, but I learn quickly.”</p>

<p>Alex muffled a snort of laughter. They all glanced at
him, but he merely gave Kelpie a look that was both
warning and mirthful.</p>

<p>Kelpie, who would have made a good general, seized
the offensive boldly. “He is thinking I want to steal things,”
she announced, nodding her tangled black head in Alex’s
direction.</p>

<p>“And do you not?” asked Glenfern bluntly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” admitted Kelpie candidly. Didn’t everyone?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“But I would not be doing it,” she went on, her blue-ringed
eyes fixed on Glenfern’s, “because you would be
sending me away if I did.”</p>

<p>It was the best thing she could have said. Glenfern
lifted his dark head with a shout of delighted laughter.
Everyone seemed pleased and amused, and Kelpie made
a mental note that truth was sometimes even more effective
than a lie. She looked demure and managed at the same
time to shoot a triumphant glance at Alex. But, disappointingly,
he only grinned.</p>

<p>“Very well so,” decided Lady Glenfern, smiling at her.
“It is not many people can claim to having a friendly
Kelpie staying with them. And I think you have it in you
to be a good lass, and trustworthy.”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked at her, deeply shocked. How could a
great lady like this be so foolishly trusting? And all of
them seemed the same—excepting Alex, of course, who
was sensibly suspicious. Kelpie definitely approved of
this, although she hated his uncanny astuteness and his
mockery. As for the rest of them, indeed and indeed, it was
a wonder they had managed to survive so long. Fooling
them was almost too easy, like catching a baby hare with
a broken leg.</p>

<p>She felt the same way all over again on that very afternoon,
after a most difficult morning.</p>

<p>The difficulties had begun almost immediately after
Kelpie’s too easy acceptance into the life of Glenfern. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
seemed that Lady Glenfern had peculiar ideas on the
subject of cleanliness and propriety. To begin with, there
was the bath, the first Kelpie had ever had, supervised
by the mistress herself, and executed by Fiona and her
formidable mother Catriona. Catriona grumbled constantly,
and Fiona crossed herself every time Kelpie looked
at her—which she did frequently and maliciously.</p>

<p>Then there was the matter of her name. “Have you not
a proper Christian name?” asked Lady Glenfern while
Kelpie’s matted hair was being violently combed and
plaited into two long, thick tails. Kelpie, unable to shake
her head, and with eyes smarting from the pulling, made
a sound that meant no.</p>

<p>“My sorrow!” remarked her new mistress. “A strange
thing to be naming a lass for a water witch! Would you
not rather be called something else? Rena, perhaps, or
Morag?”</p>

<p>But Kelpie caught a glimpse of herself just then in the
small mirror that stood on a table, and a fleeting shaft of
panic shot through her. It wasn’t herself at all! Her face
was a stranger, with the dirt off and the hair pulled back
wetly to show all of her eyes and forehead and even her
fawn-shaped ears. <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> If they changed her name as well,
perhaps she would cease altogether to be herself and become
someone else entirely!</p>

<p>“No!” she said vehemently. And the subject was
dropped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>But when they gave her a fine-woven blue woolen dress
of Eithne’s for her very own, and even something to wear
under it, she began to take a more favorable view of the
situation. And when, in the afternoon, she met Ian coming
in the front door, he hardly seemed to know her at
first. His eyes opened wide as he shook the heavy rain
from his plaidie, and then he gave her one of his rare
and sudden smiles that was like sunlight out of the
drenching sky. Kelpie grinned back, preening herself
frankly in her new finery.</p>

<p>“Och, aren’t you grand, just!” Ian said admiringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, aye,” agreed Kelpie, seeing no reason to deny it.
“But I should have a pocket and a wee bit of silver to
put in it,” she added hopefully.</p>

<p>Ian laughed at her cheekiness. “Perhaps some day,” he
said. “But I know that you will not be stealing them, for
you have said you won’t, and I trust you.”</p>

<p>There it was again! Kelpie shook her head in wonder.
That wasn’t at all the reason she wouldn’t be stealing,
and how could he be so daft as to think it? His warm
brown eyes and the lovely chiseled, sensitive curve of his
mouth quite melted Kelpie, and before she could stop
herself she was warning him.</p>

<p>“Och,” she blurted. “You mustn’t be trusting people so
easily! It is not safe whatever!”</p>

<p>“Mustn’t I trust you, then?” asked Ian gently. “Are you
not wanting to be trusted, Kelpie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed so,” explained Kelpie kindly. “Everyone is
wanting to be trusted, because then it is much easier to
fool the ones who trust them. And you may be trusting
me because you have a stick over me, but it is foolish to
do so otherwise.”</p>

<p>They looked at each other pityingly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps people are not so good as I would like to
think,” said Ian slowly. “But I think they are not so bad
as you have found them, either, Kelpie. And I would liefer
trust mistakenly than to mistrust unfairly. Do you understand
that?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Kelpie.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_5">5. Bewitchery</h2>

<p>It was a strange new life she was in, indeed! Walls and
roof were like a trap at first, although it was a grand
thing to be warm and dry with all the storm demons
howling over the earth. It was strange to have certain tasks
at certain times, too, and not easy for a gypsy lass to whom
time was nothing. It was strange to eat hot meals three
times a day, and at a table, with the heat coming from the
huge kitchen fireplace. But it was not so strange to have
the servants lowering at her suspiciously. For the clanspeople
of the glen, unlike their chief and his family, never
trusted this water witch for a moment. An evil sprite she
was, and no mistake about it. They watched every move
she made.</p>

<p>Still, suspicion was less after her first Sunday there,
after she had gathered with the others to hear Glenfern
read the service. It was well known that no witch would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
dare enter a church or hear the Holy Word, lest the roof
fall in or some other dire thing happen. Kelpie herself was
uneasy about this at first. True, she was not a witch, but
she wanted to be, and she had read the crystal with Mina,
and she wasn’t altogether certain what might happen.
Still, it wasn’t a proper church, with a priest, but only
Glenfern reading the Anglican service—and in any case,
she dared not refuse. So she went, heart beating faster
than usual, and was greatly relieved when nothing dreadful
happened.</p>

<p>True to her promise, Kelpie was diligent and learned
quickly. Her reward was free time to wander in the encircling
hills or to be with the other young people—and
this was strangest of all, for they played and chattered and
joked in a way quite novel to Kelpie, with laughter among
them, and an ease and affection that held no wariness.
Under the bewitchment of it, Kelpie found herself dropping
her own guard more and more often. She liked being
with them! There was more joy in it than in shouting and
dancing alone on a hilltop; a different excitement from
that she felt when cutting purses. As the days passed, she
often had to remind herself of the advice she had given
Ian. To be too relaxed could be dangerous—especially with
that sharp-minded Alex about.</p>

<p>Still, she couldn’t help enjoying those hours, and presently
something clicked in her mind, and she understood
the baffling thing they called teasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Kelpie, Eithne, Ian, and Alex were sitting nearly waist-deep
in the tangle of heather and bog-myrtle that rimmed
Loch nan Eilean on a sunny afternoon.</p>

<p>“Are you <em>sure</em> you’re not wanting a proper name besides
‘Kelpie’?” Eithne asked, her soft voice worried and laughing
at once. “It seems so insulting, just, that your parents....”</p>

<p>Parents? Suddenly Kelpie remembered what Bogle had
said. Suppose she had truly been stolen? Suppose she
were really the daughter of a chief? Och, the glory of it!
Wealth and importance, lovely gowns and jewels, silver
buckles on real leather shoes, and a silver belt around her
waist, and oh, the safety of never having to run from angry
crowds....</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” she announced eagerly. “Mina and Bogle will
not be my parents, at all.” She paused dramatically and
prepared to launch the rest of her news. How startled and
respectful they would be! Why hadn’t she thought of it
sooner?</p>

<p>“Och, now!” Alex turned twin sparks of laughter upon
her. “And haven’t I been waiting, just, for you to be telling
us? Kelpie has suddenly remembered,” he explained to the
others solemnly, “that she was stolen by the gypsies when
a wee bairn and is truly the daughter of a great chief, or
perhaps of royal blood.”</p>

<p>“How did you know?” began Kelpie and then stopped.
The others were chuckling as at a great joke. Alex had put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the blight of ridicule on her story—though it was at least
half true. And now no one would ever be believing it at
all!</p>

<p>“Beast!” she spat. “It is <em>true</em>!”</p>

<p>“As ever was!” agreed Alex jauntily and ducked her
angry fist. Then he caught her wrist, put it firmly in her
lap, and sat grinning at her. “You’re a wonderful wee liar,
aren’t you just?” he observed admiringly.</p>

<p>“Ou, aye,” admitted Kelpie a trifle smugly before she
realized that he had tricked her again. “But this time,” she
pointed out with indignation, “I am not lying.”</p>

<p>“And would you not be saying the same thing if you
were lying?” he persisted.</p>

<p>This time Kelpie saw the trap, but she was already in it.
“Of course,” she admitted with forthright logic. “For what
would be the good of lying if you did not say it was the
truth? But”—she bristled, slanted brows scrambling themselves
darkly above her short nose—“<em>this</em> time it <em>is</em> true!”</p>

<p>Alex laughed.</p>

<p>Kelpie tried for at least the twentieth time to put the
Evil Eye on him. The result was a poisonous look, if not a
blighting one. “Wicked, evil-minded beast!” she told him
earnestly.</p>

<p>Ian looked at Alex judiciously. “Och, no; not wicked,”
he said. “He’s a bit evil-minded, ’tis true, and surely daft.”</p>

<p>Kelpie blinked.</p>

<p>“Aye, daft enough,” agreed Eithne happily. “Were you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
knowing, Kelpie, that he’s altogether foolish about an
English lass, his cousin Cecily in Oxford? And yet all he
can be saying of her is that she is like her own wee kitten,
and that he will marry with her some day.”</p>

<p>Alex grinned brazenly. “Well, and with who else?” he
demanded. “You would not be having me, <i lang="gd">m’eudail</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé</i>, no!” agreed Eithne promptly. “I’d as lief marry
the twins!”</p>

<p>“Mayhap Kelpie would have him,” suggested Ian lazily,
and then he and Eithne shouted with laughter at the looks
of sheer horror on both faces.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” begged Alex, getting to his knees and clasping
his hands pleadingly. “Anything but that! Curse me all
you wish, water witch, but <em>please</em> do not marry me!”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked at him. It was then that something
clicked. “Very well so,” she agreed with enthusiasm. “And
what sort of curse would you be wanting?”</p>

<p class="tb">She went back to the house a little later, looking thoughtful
and with a pleasant feeling in the heart of her—not
merely because, for once, she had got the better of Alex,
but also because of the thing that happened between
people when they teased. It was a warm and happy thing
that turned insults to joking and the hatred of Alex to
something kinder. For surely a body did not tease where
he hated! And surely he had been half teasing her from
the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Kelpie’s blue eyes glinted happily as she hurried into
the big stone-floored kitchen, so that Marsali the cook
almost smiled at her and Fiona for once forgot to cross
herself.</p>

<p>“And about time it is, too!” Marsali grunted, remembering
her doubts about Kelpie. “The mistress has been
looking for you while you were playing like a fine lady.
Here, now, be helping to pluck this fowl, and let Master
Donald go tell her that you’re here.”</p>

<p>Kelpie glanced at the half of the twins who was arming
himself for an afternoon of fishing, with a huge packet
of scones and butter. “That’s Ronald,” she said absently
as she picked up the small brown pheasant.</p>

<p>Three pairs of eyes focused on her in sudden sharp
attention, for it took far more than a brief glance to tell
one twin from the other. In fact, only their mother and
Wee Mairi could invariably do it.</p>

<p>“I’m Donald,” asserted the twin, his eyes sparkling at
her.</p>

<p>“You’re Ronald.” Kelpie contradicted him serenely,
hardly glancing up from her plucking job.</p>

<p>Marsali at once took sides. “Och, now, will you be calling
the wee master a liar?” she demanded indignantly, her
fists planted against her hips.</p>

<p>“Ou, aye,” said Kelpie. “He will be teasing you,” she
added, pleased to recognize it.</p>

<p>Fiona looked shocked. Marsali peered suspiciously from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Kelpie to the twin, who giggled. “Och, well, then,” said
Marsali, her ruddy face now ruddier with indignation,
though she was not quite sure at whom to direct it. “Fine
it is that Master Ronald has the wee mole on the back of
his neck.” And she strode over to the grinning lad and
lifted up the shoulder-length dark hair to look at the neck
beneath. Kelpie went on plucking, perfectly sure of herself
and feeling rather smug.</p>

<p>“Master Ronald it <em>is</em>!” Marsali clucked, and Fiona
crossed herself and edged away from Kelpie. “How could
you be knowing, save with the Black Power?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” demanded Ronald. “How were you knowing,
Kelpie? Was it witchcraft?”</p>

<p>Kelpie grinned and shrugged. She couldn’t really tell
how she knew. It wasn’t the look of them, but rather the
feel. Donald had a more aggressive and challenging tone,
and Ronald more a feel of hungry curiosity. But how
could a body explain this kind of knowing? No, they
would just have to think it witchcraft.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Mise-an-dhui!</i>” muttered Marsali, regarding her warily.
Fiona had backed against the far wall. Donald appeared
in search of his twin, and the two went into a conference.
Presently they came out of it and presented a solid front
to Kelpie, sturdy legs planted wide.</p>

<p>“That is no proof you are a witch,” announced Donald.
“Mother and Wee Mairi can tell us apart, and they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
no witches, only Mother is knowing us too well and Mairi
has Second Sight.”</p>

<p>Kelpie yielded to temptation, made a horrible grimace,
and began weaving mysterious signs in the air with her
fingers. Fiona screeched, and Marsali turned pale. The
twins stood their ground, grinning, belligerent, deeply
interested—and just faintly worried.</p>

<p>“Now whatever is all this?” It was Lady Glenfern herself,
her full mauve skirts nearly filling the wide doorway,
with Eithne, round-eyed, just behind.</p>

<p>“Witchcraft!” squeaked Fiona.</p>

<p>Kelpie flushed guiltily and found a sudden lump in her
throat. Och, here was a mess! Why had she done such a
foolish thing? All in fun it was, and yet who would believe
her for a minute? Now she would be punished and sent
away—and, for once, for a thing of which she was innocent!
The novelty of the situation was so shattering that
for once she lost her glib tongue. She simply stared at her
mistress, her eyes growing wide with frustration and despair.</p>

<p>The twins and Marsali broke into simultaneous explanations—all
slightly different—with Fiona putting in exclamation
points here and there, so that it was some time
before Lady Glenfern could get an idea of what had
happened. When she did, she turned questioningly to
Kelpie, who was still trying to think up some lie that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sounded more plausible than the truth. But Eithne spoke
first.</p>

<p>“Och, then, Mother!” she said, laughter and distress in
her voice. “She was teasing; I am sure of it. Look you how
the twins are always at her to cast a spell, and Fiona just
begging to be teased by the very look of her. I am sure
that was the way of it! Was it not, Kelpie?”</p>

<p>Kelpie nodded a bit sullenly. This was humiliating.
She wished she really had power to do a wee magic spell
and dared show them, just to see their surprise.</p>

<p>“Well—” Lady Glenfern hesitated, inclined to believe
it, but not quite sure. After all....</p>

<p>At that moment Wee Mairi popped into the kitchen,
looking, in her full skirts, like a fairy child caught in an
overblown rose. And, like a fairy child, she knew instantly
that something was wrong, and what to do about it. She
pattered across the floor and slipped her small, soft hand
into Kelpie’s.</p>

<p>“This is <em>my</em> Kelpie,” she announced, smiling angelically
at her mother. “’Tis myself loves her, and you must not
be cross at her.”</p>

<p>“There, Mother!” crowed Eithne. “Wee Mairi loves her,
and Mairi has the Second Sight; you said yourself that
she is never making a mistake about a person!”</p>

<p>Lady Glenfern relaxed. “Aye so,” she agreed and smiled
at Kelpie. “I can well see how you were tempted to tease,”
she admitted and then became grave. “But you must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
careful, lass. To joke about such matters could cause you
sore trouble.”</p>

<p>Kelpie hardly heard the warning. Her hand was gripping
the small one still protectively clinging to it, and she
found herself again seized by an alarming surge of feeling
for its owner. Och, the fair, sweet heart of her....</p>

<p>Wee Mairi chose this instant to lean confidingly against
Kelpie and peer up with a beguiling smile. “<em>My</em> Kelpie,”
she repeated.</p>

<p>And Kelpie was swallowed in a tide of the first real love
she had ever known. She found it extremely upsetting.
All her training and experience warned her that it was
dangerous to be trapped into this sort of feeling. It left
one vulnerable, could lead one into foolishness. And here
she was, bewitched, unable to help it! She scowled helplessly.</p>

<p>Lady Glenfern, seeing her distress, mercifully took her
from the kitchen for the rest of the day and set her to
work at a simple bit of weaving. For an hour or so Kelpie
sat alone, brooding. Eithne came in for a while to work at
her own more complicated length of Cameron tartan, but
Kelpie was so unsociable that she left again.</p>

<p>And then the twins arrived, dark heads cocked to one
side, eyes dancing at her impishly. “We have found you,”
they announced in triumph.</p>

<p>“Fine I know it,” growled Kelpie, refusing to look at
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Undaunted, they seated themselves on two wee creepie-stools
and regarded her with affable curiosity. “There is
a thing that we have in our minds,” they told her.</p>

<p>“I am doubting that!” snapped Kelpie.</p>

<p>The twins digested this insult and then chuckled. “I
am liking you fine,” said Donald, “even though you are
not a witch.”</p>

<p>Kelpie, touched again on that newly sensitive spot, shot
the shuttle through the warp with unnecessary violence
and said nothing.</p>

<p>“Why were you saying you are a witch when you are
not?” asked Ronald with interest. “Why,” he continued,
getting warmed up, “do Fiona and the others think you
are? Would you like to be? Are you truly Old Mina’s girl?
Is she your Grannie Witchie? If you were a witch, Kelpie,
what would you do first of all?”</p>

<p>“Put a spell of silence on the tongue of you,” retorted
Kelpie and found that her ill humor was beginning to
evaporate. It was impossible not to smile back at their
cheeky grins, not to chuckle when they said that Mother
would probably approve such a spell. The atmosphere
became quite congenial.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going fishing,” observed Kelpie.</p>

<p>The twins looked depressed. “We were,” they agreed.
“But Father is come back from seeing Lochiel and told
us to bide here for our lessons that we missed this morning.
I think ’twill take him a wee while to find us in here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
whatever,” added Ronald cheerfully, and Kelpie grinned
again.</p>

<p>“We are learning about the war between King Charles
and Parliament and the Covenant,” volunteered Donald
sadly, “and we could do fine <em>not</em> knowing about it. Grownups
are gey confusing, so they are, and sometimes I think
gey foolish besides, and we are not understanding it all
very well.”</p>

<p>“Are you loving King Charles?” demanded Ronald.</p>

<p>“Ou, aye,” murmured Kelpie vaguely and hastened to
turn the question. “Are you?” she countered.</p>

<p>“As ever was!” they chorused instantly. “Is he not our
King, and a Stewart, besides?”</p>

<p>Well, Kelpie had already known that Glenfern was pro-Royalist.
“And so the King is always right?” she pursued,
trying to think what else to ask.</p>

<p>“Och, no!” said the twins in surprise. “No one is always
right,” they informed her gravely. “Except,” they added,
“for Father.”</p>

<p>Kelpie put her shuttle through the wrong way and had
to take it out again, her lip twitching ever so slightly. The
twins, having settled that subject of conversation, looked
at her hopefully. “Can you,” they asked, “tell us a story?”</p>

<p>Now if there was one thing Kelpie could do better than
any other, it was to tell stories—pathetic tales to earn
sympathy or a copper, outrageous lies to escape impending
trouble, embroidered yarns of her own adventures, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
gypsy stories, eerie folk tales of the wee people and other
uncanny beings, or fanciful bits and snatches that she
wove for herself among the hills or beside the campfire.
Her eyes sparkled. “Fine I can that!” she asserted and
dropped her voice to an eerie pitch.</p>

<p>“Have you ever,” she whispered, “heard of the <i lang="gd">uruisg</i> of
Glenlyon?”</p>

<p>They shook their heads and drew their stools nearer.</p>

<p>“Well, then.” Kelpie paused, shuttle in hand. “It was a
farmer’s wife who was making porridge for breakfast on
a wet morning, when who should come walking in but an
<i lang="gd">uruisg</i>. Och, a slippery, damp, uncouth monster he was,
half man and half goat; and wasn’t he just sitting himself
down at the fire to dry, and not so much as a wee greeting
to her? Well, the farmer’s wife was fair angered at his
impertinence, and she having to step over and around him
every minute, so presently she just lifted a ladle of the
boiling porridge from the pot over the fire, and poured it
over him, just. Well, at that he leaped up, howling, and
ran out the door and never dared set foot in that house
again....”</p>

<p>When Glenfern finally tracked down his elusive twins
some time later, Kelpie had got very little weaving done,
but she had made a place for herself forever in the hearts
of Ronald and Donald.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_6">6. The Picture in the Loch</h2>

<p>“’Tis a terrible complicated matter, the war,” objected
Eithne doubtfully as she began basting a
sleeve into what was to be a fine linen shirt for Ian’s birthday.
“I fear I’d only be confusing you.”</p>

<p>Kelpie surveyed the four or five yards of red and green
tartan wool which constituted a kilt for a small lad, and
wondered how even Donald could have managed to tear
such stout weave. “I could not be more confused than I
am,” she pointed out, “for I am knowing nothing at all.
Tell me at least a little.”</p>

<p>Eithne sighed and obeyed. “Well,” she began hesitantly,
“you know that King Charles is King of England and Scotland
both?” Kelpie nodded. “But in both countries are
representative bodies of men called Parliaments, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
help to rule. They are supposed to agree with the things
the King does, and it is the English parliament who must
vote to give him things like extra money when he needs
it—which he usually does.”</p>

<p>She paused to squint critically at her basting, and Kelpie
waited. Somehow she had developed a great eagerness
to learn about the matters which had thrown England and
Scotland into civil war. “Aye, go on,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Well, so. Neither King Charles nor his father before
him has got along well with Parliament. King and Parliament
each said the other will be trying to take more rights
and power than they should have, and they became angry.
Parliament would refuse to vote money for the King, so
the King would dissolve Parliament, which meant that
they could not meet any more to vote on anything at all
until King Charles called them back, and so everyone was
unhappy.”</p>

<p>She bit off her thread and held the shirt closer to the
dim light which filtered through the thick diamond-shaped
mullion panes of the casement window. “And
then”—she sighed—“religion came into it. Father,” she
remarked severely, “says that religion should never be
mixed with politics, but they do not listen to wise people
like Father, and so there is trouble.”</p>

<p>“What has religion to do with it?” asked Kelpie curiously.
She had never known anything of religion for herself,
only that the stern Kirk of the Lowlands had severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
views on all other faiths, on fun and laughter, and most
particularly on witches. But the Anglican services here at
Glenfern seemed peaceful and vaguely pleasant, even
though she did not understand them.</p>

<p>“Och!” protested Eithne, but Kelpie’s face was implacable,
so she went on. “Well, the Catholics and Protestants
do not like each other, and especially the Protestants of
the new Reformed Church, like the Puritans in England
and the Calvinist Covenanters in Scotland—and we Anglicans
caught in the middle. King Charles is Anglican, but
the Parliament is mostly Puritan, I think. At any rate, they
were very angry when the King married Queen Henrietta,
who is a Roman Catholic and said she would turn the
country all Catholic and burn Protestants at the stake.
And the Catholics said the Protestants were trying to rule
the country and force their religion on everyone, and so it
was a fine braw quarrel for years, with religion and politics
all mixed together.”</p>

<p>Kelpie carefully selected a strand of wool to match the
soft, dull red of the Cameron tartan. This was the most
difficult bit of mending she had yet been trusted with.
“Mmm,” she murmured after a minute, turning her mind
back to the conversation. “And then?”</p>

<p>It was Eithne’s turn to pause, while the rain beat against
the casement windows. Wee Mairi turned from her doll
to lift a merry smile in the direction of “her Kelpie,” who
felt a new pang of affection. Och, the bonnie wee thing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Eithne scowled at the shirt and then glanced up at Kelpie
with a rueful shrug. “Ou, I cannot mind me of all the
details.” She sighed again. “But the quarrel turned into
fighting.”</p>

<p>“But what of Scotland?” demanded Kelpie. “What had
it to do with us at all?”</p>

<p>“Why,” interrupted the dry voice of Alex, “King Charles
himself must be bringing that on!” They looked up to see
him standing in the doorway, a shirt in his hand and a wry
grin on his angular face. “Scotland might have been loyal
to him, even though all the Lowlands are Calvinist, and
even more rigid than the Puritans, but he had the bright
idea of forcing the Anglican prayer book on Scotland. And
the next thing he knew, there was a Solemn League and
Covenant formed against him, and Scotland divided as
England was, with Lowlands against the King, and most
of the Highlands loyal to him.”</p>

<p>Eithne looked both relieved and worried, while Kelpie
studied Alex’s expression in the dim light, not quite certain
if he were teasing or not. She decided not—for once.
There was a faint note of bitterness in his voice. “I thought
you were a King’s man!” she challenged him.</p>

<p>“I am so,” he returned promptly and unpropped himself
from the doorway. “Look you, Eithne,” he went on,
crossing the room to her. “I have ripped my shirt sorely
and am needing a bonnie sweet lass to mend it for me.”</p>

<p>Eithne tilted her chestnut curls at him and wrinkled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
her nose in an impish grin. “If I do,” she said, bargaining,
“will you be explaining the rest of the war to Kelpie?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” said Alex and raised both eyebrows at Kelpie.</p>

<p>“She is truly wanting to know,” said Eithne sternly, “so
do not be teasing her, Alex. And I am gey muddled about
it, and you knowing so much more, with having been at
Oxford and even seeing the King and his family yourself.
Will you?”</p>

<p>“’Tis a hard bargain,” complained Alex, “and I am
thinking I pity the man who will one day marry you,
Eithne <i lang="gd">m’eudail</i>.” He perched on the corner of the massive
table, his kilt falling in heavy folds about his lean knees.
“Well, then, and what bit of my great knowledge should
I be sharing with you first?”</p>

<p>Kelpie gave him a wicked pointed smile. “Tell me,” she
said softly, “in one word, just, <em>what are they fighting for?</em>”</p>

<p>“My sorrow!” exclaimed Alex, straightening up as if he
had sat on a thistle. “Is that all?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” asked Kelpie tauntingly. “I will tell
you, then. They’re fighting for power. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>Alex resumed his perch and surveyed her ruefully.
“Och, and are you not the young cynic!” he observed.
“And you have shocked my foster sister, too.” For Eithne
was looking both dismayed and indignant. Both girls had
forgotten their sewing for the moment and sat staring at
Alex challengingly, waiting for his opinion.</p>

<p>He laughed. “I fear me I shall anger you both,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
remarked, “and go through the rest of my life with an evil
spell on my head and a tom sleeve in my shirt.”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Kelpie.</p>

<p>Alex gave her a crooked grin. “Sorry I am to agree with
you even in part,” he confessed, “but no doubt some men
are fighting for power. No, no, Eithne,” he added as she
opened her mouth. “Do not deny it too quickly. What
about Argyll?”</p>

<p>Eithne subsided.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, Alex <i lang="gd">avic</i>, there is Montrose.” It
was Ian. He pulled up a hassock and ranged himself
quietly but firmly on Eithne’s side.</p>

<p>“Montrose?” asked Kelpie.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Ian, turning his warm smile upon her. “James
Graham of Montrose, and he one of the finest, truest men
under the sun. He it is who is named to fight for the King’s
cause in Scotland, even to form and organize the army.
And he is fighting for no selfish reason whatever, but only
for what he believes to be right. Alex cannot deny it, for
we both met and talked to him last winter in Oxford.”</p>

<p>“Indeed and I’ll not deny it,” agreed Alex amiably,
“though Kelpie might. My point was just that all men are
not like Montrose, and my proof of it is still Argyll. Och,
and have you done, my sonsie Eithne?” he added as she
held up the mended shirt. “Come away, then, Ian, and
let’s be outside. I believe the sun is going to come out.”</p>

<p>And they were gone before Kelpie could ask about Argyll.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Perhaps it was as well, she decided, going back to
her mending. For she really thought she had heard quite
as much as she could absorb all in one lump.</p>

<p>Eithne flickered a mischievous sideways glance at her.
“And wasn’t I warning you ’twas complicated?” she murmured.</p>

<p class="tb">As if by tacit agreement, no one brought up matters like
war and politics for some time. After all, it was easy
enough, in that peaceful, secluded glen, to put such things
far out of mind. Kelpie’s free hours were full enough, as
spring days became longer, with other things. Wee Mairi
tagged along with her, a self-appointed guardian, and the
glenspeople had learned to hide their hostility when Mairi
was there. The twins were insatiably hungry for more
stories—and so, for that matter, were the older young
people. Books were rare and precious, and mostly devoted
to serious and difficult subjects. And, as Ian generously
remarked on a sunny afternoon by the loch, Kelpie was a
master at telling tales.</p>

<p>Alex grinned impishly. “She is that!” he agreed with a
wicked twinkle in his eye and a double meaning to his
voice which Kelpie chose to ignore.</p>

<p>“Next time I will tell you about the <i lang="gd">sithiche</i> (fairies) of
Loch Maree—<em>if</em> you are all very kind to me,” she said
blandly and glanced impudently at Alex.</p>

<p>She sat on alone by the loch for a little while after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
others had left, thinking about things. How Alex had
changed since she first met him! He was much nicer than
she had thought. And she had begun to like his teasing
and mockery, for it was all good-humored.... Or was it
perhaps herself had changed? And if so—She rolled over
to lie full-length on her face in the fragrant long grasses
and pondered. Then, lazily, she stretched until her head
was over the edge of the loch.</p>

<p>What was her real self like? Had that changed? Could
it?</p>

<p>The bank at this point rose abruptly about two feet
above the glassy surface of the water, with tough curling
roots of heather overhanging the edge. Kelpie reached
down skillfully, scooped up a handful of the cold water,
and drank it from her palm before it could run through
her fingers. The surface rippled slightly and returned to
its mirror stillness, with sky, hills, and trees reflected so
clearly that it would be hard to tell the reflection from the
real. Or was one, perhaps, as real as the other?</p>

<p>She stared down at her own face, still looking indecently
bare with all the thick dark hair pulled back into plaits.
Was that any less real—or more—than the scenes she saw
in Mina’s crystal?</p>

<p>And then it was no longer her own face she was seeing,
but a town street and an ugly-tempered crowd surging
down it. Not merely annoyed, that crowd, but murderous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Kelpie shivered a little, for she knew too well how bestial
a mob could be. And this one had a victim, for there was
savage satisfaction in the grim Lowland faces above their
sober Covenanter garments, pressing closer and closer....
And there was Ian! Whatever could he be doing in
the Lowlands? Pushing through the crowd, he was; and
Alex came after, shouting at him, his angular face all
twisted with fury. And now they were closer, and Alex
was catching up to Ian.... Alex was lifting his sword,
and through the crowd Kelpie could see him bring it
down savagely.... <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> Ian had fallen, his dark head
vanished in the throng! And Alex’s sword with blood on
it!</p>

<p>Kelpie jerked with horror, and a bit of dry heather
plopped into the water—and the picture was gone. Nor
did it return, though she waited, staring at the still water
and brooding bitterly.</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> That serpent Alex! She had never liked him from
the beginning! And now he was going to turn on his foster
brother, strike him down from behind, perhaps kill him—for
the Sight never lied.</p>

<p>She tried to tell herself that it didn’t matter to her, but
it was too late. Ian had crept into her heart, and Wee
Mairi, and the rest of them. Even Alex, deceitful scoundrel
that he was, had somehow tricked her into liking him—for
a while, anyway. But now she knew better. Och, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
must try to warn Ian! Even if he could not prevent it, perhaps
he could be on his guard, could put off the evil day
of it, could duck in time to save his life.</p>

<p>Dismayed, angry, resolute, Kelpie got to her feet,
smoothed down the full folds of her blue dress, and started
back up the loch.</p>

<p class="tb">Now what, wondered Alex, had got under the skin of
their wolf cub lately? For there was a new venom toward
himself—and after he had been thinking her nearly tamed,
too. Aye, a wolf cub: belligerent, cunning, snarling, biting,
thieving, destructive—and yet innocent, as a wolf cub is
innocent because it knows nothing else.</p>

<p>But she had been changing. She had been learning
trust and affection, even to play and tease. And now, suddenly,
there was a new and deadly hatred smoldering at
him from those ringed eyes. It was puzzling, it was, and
rather less amusing than her old spitting indignation had
been; and even though it could hardly be a tragedy to
him, still it was disconcerting. Alex kept a wary eye on
her, lest she should decide to take her <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> to his
back.</p>

<p>As for Kelpie, she found the business of warning Ian a
bit harder than it had seemed. For one thing, it was none
so easy to find him alone, for he and Alex were usually
together and about their own affairs, while Kelpie had her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
tasks in the house. In the evenings the family sat together
in the withdrawing room, which was not Kelpie’s place.
The big warm kitchen, or her wee cot in Marsali’s room,
was where she belonged, or—more often—away by herself
outside, in the pale half-light of the long northern
gloaming. For summer was drawing near, and darkness
now merely brushed down late upon the world and, like
a gull’s wing, quickly lifted.</p>

<p>So she glared at Alex and did her tasks and kept her
eyes and ears open and bided her time. And at last Alex
went off for a few days to visit his brother in Ardochy.
And the next evening Kelpie, on one of her rambles, saw
Ian on the hill above her, quietly looking down over the
glen.</p>

<p>Kelpie drew near, and then paused. Och, a braw lad
he was! But how might she be approaching him best? It
might be he wanted to be alone. Before she could decide,
Ian saw her, smiled, beckoned, his face oddly blurred in
the half-light that turned all things gray. She sat beside
him and for a minute followed his gaze over the long
shadowed cup of the glen, lit by the silver gleam of Loch
nan Eilean.</p>

<p>Finally Ian stirred and spoke. “I wish I might never
need to leave it again,” he said wistfully.</p>

<p>Did he love it so? Kelpie dimly sensed that he did; but
she did not understand, for she herself had no roots to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
heart, but only a wanderlust to her feet. “And must you,
then?” she asked. Why could Ian not be doing as he
pleased, since he was the heir to Glenfern?</p>

<p>“Aye so,” he said, a bit more briskly. “For I must finish
my schooling if I am to be a fit chieftain and leader to my
people. However”—he brightened considerably—“I think
we’ll not be able to return to Oxford for some time, with
the war moving northward and becoming more serious,
and Argyll endangering all the Highlands.”</p>

<p>Now was the moment for her to warn him about Alex.
But it was also a chance to ask about Argyll and put off
the more difficult thing. “Tell me about Argyll!” she
urged.</p>

<p>Ian turned to look at her with friendly interest. “You’ve
a good head on you, haven’t you, Kelpie? Mother says
you’re quick to learn and that you speak English as well
as Gaelic. Are you truly interested in national affairs,
then?” Kelpie nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” began Ian, “you know who Argyll is, do
you not? Mac Cailein Mor, Chief of Clan Campbell in the
Highlands, and also head of the Covenant Army of the
Lowlands. So he has that power added to the power of
his own clan, and he uses it ill, Kelpie. He is a vicious man,
cruel, ambitious, and vindictive.”</p>

<p>Kelpie could not resist a gibe. “And is he not also a
Campbell, and his clan at feud with yours?” she remarked.</p>

<p>Ian flushed. Even in the dusk she could see it. “’Tis not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that!” he protested. “I am not one to hate a man for his
name, Kelpie! And in any case, my own uncle married a
Campbell lass; and the son of Lochiel, our own clan chief,
married Argyll’s sister, and we are anxious to be at peace.
But Argyll, devil that he is, wishes to dictate his own
terms entirely. Do you know what he has done, Kelpie?
He has taken his nephew Ewen—Lochiel’s own grandson,
who will be chief of the Camerons some day—and is keeping
him at his own castle of Inverary. He says he wishes
to see to his education—and I can guess what kind of
education ’twill be—but do you see that Ewen is hostage
for Lochiel’s actions? And if Lochiel dares to take the side
of the King against Argyll—”</p>

<p>“Mmmm,” said Kelpie, seeing.</p>

<p>“Nor is it just our clan,” Ian went on, deep anger in his
voice. “He was commissioned to secure the Highlands for
the Covenant, which is bad enough, for we have not tried
to inflict our politics or religion on them. But Argyll has
used his commission and the Lowland army to settle his
private grudges. He burned the great house of Airly, with
no enemy there but a helpless woman. And he burned
and ravaged the lands of MacDonald of Keppoch, and is
even now laying waste the lands of Gordon of Huntly.
They say he would make himself King Campbell, and a
black day for Scotland if he should.”</p>

<p>Kelpie remembered the face she had seen once in the
crystal, which Mina had called Mac Cailein Mor, Marquis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of Argyll. A cold, cruel face it had been, with twisted
sneering mouth, a heavy and pendulous nose, and a squint
in the crafty eyes of him, so that one couldn’t be just sure
what he was looking at.</p>

<p>“Aye,” she agreed suddenly. “He is a red-haired <i lang="gd">uruisg</i>.
I have been seeing him helping with his own hands to
fire the homes and burn people too.” She didn’t add that
the people burned were accused of witchcraft, as this
might not be a tactful thing to mention.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen that?” exclaimed Ian.</p>

<p>“In the crystal, only,” confessed Kelpie. “I was also seeing
him mounting the scaffold to be hanged,” she remembered
with relish. “But,” she added regretfully, “he
was looking much older then.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” exclaimed Ian, deeply impressed. “I did not
know you were having the Second Sight, Kelpie.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Kelpie. And here was her opening. “Ian!”
she blurted, quite forgetting to give him a respectful title.
“You must not be trusting Alex MacDonald.”</p>

<p>“Not trust Alex?” Ian turned a dumfounded face to
hers. And then he laughed. “Och, Kelpie, there is no one
in the world I trust better! We are sworn brothers, and if
my life were to rest in the two hands of him, there is no
place I would sooner have it.”</p>

<p>“And you would lose it, then,” said Kelpie flatly. “For
I had a Seeing, and his sword fell upon you from behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and you fell. And there was anger on his face and blood
upon his sword.”</p>

<p>Ian’s face was a pale blob in the dusk, and she could not
see it turn white—and yet she knew, somehow, that it
did. For the Second Sight never lied.</p>

<p>And in spite of that, Ian shook his head. “I cannot believe
it, Kelpie,” he said quietly. “It is a mistake, for the
sun would fall from the sky before Alex could be untrue.”</p>

<p>Kelpie thrust an angry face, long eyes glittering, close
to his. “You think I am lying, but I am not. I would have
been warning you, even though it is of no profit to me,
whatever. But it is a spell he has cast upon you! And,”
she added bitterly, “you will be discovering it too late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_7">7. The Return of Mina and Bogle</h2>

<p>Summer was upon the Highlands. The serene curves of
the hills glowed with a hundred shades of green and
tawny and rose, all with a faintly unreal, spirit-of-opal
quality, so that the distances looked no more solid than a
rainbow.</p>

<p>Kelpie breathed the salt wind as she climbed higher
above the glen, and stared hungrily at the distant hills.
For she was beginning to feel restless. A wee glen was not
space enough, and there were too many people, too much
routine, and she must away to the hills to be alone. Here
were only the mild shaggy cattle peering mournfully from
behind long fringes of hair, and the hares and red deer,
the hill larks and whaups and gulls, and an eagle—high
and alone in the free air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Her acute senses had been lulled by the months of
security at Glenfern, and she was startled to see the bent,
wiry figure of Mina rise unexpectedly from behind a
clump of juniper.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, and Kelpie’s expression
could not possibly have been mistaken for delight. Mina
took one good look at it, swung back her strong, scrawny
arm, and aimed it at Kelpie.</p>

<p>It seemed that Kelpie’s reactions as well as her senses
had become rusty. She didn’t duck in time. And, since
Mina had fully expected her to, the resounding smack
startled and pained them both.</p>

<p>Mina shook her stinging hand and glared at Kelpie as
if the girl had done it on purpose. Kelpie, her head ringing,
glared back. And Black Bogle, who had appeared as
silently as his eerie namesake, shook with malicious laughter.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Amadain!</i>” grumbled Mina sourly. “Forgotten everything
you ever knew! Fine-lady clothes and clean face,
and hands that will have lost all their cunning—such as
it was. Blind and deaf and slow as a sleeping snail. <i lang="gd">Amadain!</i>”</p>

<p>“Sssss!” remarked Kelpie, looking and sounding like a
wrathful snake. She had forgotten how ugly and mean
and dirty Mina was. Och, how she hated her!</p>

<p>Mina looked pleased. She enjoyed Kelpie’s impotent
hatred. And Kelpie, knowing this, controlled her feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and hooded her eyes and made her sharp-jawed small
mouth curl upward. She had been a fool to show her feelings
at all at all!</p>

<p>“Come away, then,” ordered Mina, suddenly becoming
brisk. “You have kept us waiting long enough! Why weren’t
you coming as soon as you got my message?”</p>

<p>“What message?” asked Kelpie blankly. Mina’s eyes
blazed with fury and humiliation. Bogle laughed aloud,
and Kelpie knew that Mina had tried to send her a message
by magic—and it hadn’t worked. Och, but she must
say something quickly, or no telling what Mina might do!</p>

<p>“It would be yon red-haired serpent down there,” she
said improvising hastily. “He was no doubt setting up a
spell to prevent your message from reaching me. Teach
me to say spells, Mina,” she wheedled, “so that I may set
one on him.”</p>

<p>It worked. Mina’s pride was saved, and her wrath
turned from Kelpie to Alex. “I will be cursing him myself,”
she growled. “He is the same one who would not
pay me enough when you were hurt, and who would not
let you steal? Very well so! He will pay, and the others as
well. We will go now and demand your wages before you
leave.”</p>

<p>Leave? Kelpie’s heart sank. Back to the old life of fear,
hatred, beatings? Away from Wee Mairi and Ian and the
companionship and teasing? She backed up a step and
braced herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for should I want to leave?” She stuck out her
jaw rebelliously, and Mina slapped it.</p>

<p>“Because I am saying so!” she snarled. “And because I
will put an evil curse on you if you do not obey.”</p>

<p>Kelpie prudently pulled in her smarting jaw and considered
this. On one hand, Mina was not as powerful as
Kelpie had thought, for she almost certainly could not
read the crystal alone, and her magic message had failed
to get through. But that was not to say she could not
curse. Kelpie still had great faith in the power of Mina’s
evil spells. And Mina’s curse would be even more disagreeable
than her company. Kelpie brooded darkly over
the unpleasant alternatives before her, almost inclined to
risk the curse.</p>

<p>“Why would you not want to come?” demanded Mina,
and her cursing changed to wheedling. “And here I have
been to the trouble of arranging for you to learn witchcraft
at last, ungrateful wretch that you are, then! What,
would you stay to be a slave to arrogant fools such as
these? Stupid sheep, spending their lives shut in a wee
glen?”</p>

<p>“They do not, then,” muttered Kelpie mutinously. “Ian
and Alex have been to school in England in a place called
Oxford, and have seen the King and Montrose and know
more than we about affairs. And they do not beat me, nor
make me steal for them and then set the crowd on me.
And I do not believe you plan to teach me witchcraft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
whatever, for you are always promising it and never do
it.”</p>

<p>Mina’s face darkened, and she raised a scrawny, strong
arm again, but Bogle loomed over her and drew her aside
to speak for a moment in a voice like distant thunder.
Kelpie watched apprehensively. When Bogle intervened,
it was never for motives of kindness and charity.</p>

<p>“Hah!” Mina cackled presently and turned back to
Kelpie. “And what of the wee bittie lass we were seeing
you playing with so tenderly this morning? Shall I put
a curse on her, too? Aye, on all the glen I shall put the
Evil Eye, so that they will all wither up and die horrible
deaths!”</p>

<p>Kelpie’s defiance collapsed like a deflated bagpipe. Not
Wee Mairi! She could not bear to risk harm for her bonnie
bairn. But she must not let Mina know how vulnerable
she was on this point, or she would be in slavery and Wee
Mairi in danger forever more! Carefully keeping her face
impassive, she shrugged indifferently. “Och, well, just
do not be putting it on me,” she murmured, and noted
that both Mina and Bogle looked disappointed. “And will
you truly be teaching me witchcraft if I come?” she
demanded, as if this were her only interest.</p>

<p>“Have I not said so?” Mina growled. “Was it trying to
drive a hard bargain you were, then? I should beat you
for it! Come away down, now, for we have wasted too
much time already.” And she led the way down the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the twins who first spotted the assorted trio approaching,
and they began to shout excitedly.</p>

<p>“Kelpie, is yon your Grannie Witchie? Father, Ian, come
and see!” they yelled in full voice. And then, short kilts
swinging, they raced up the slope to stare at Mina and
Bogle with frank, fearless curiosity.</p>

<p>“Are you truly a witch?” demanded Ronald, and, in
spite of her gloom, Kelpie stifled a grin at the look on
Mina’s face.</p>

<p>The old woman drew herself up and glared at them.
“Best not be asking that!” she warned in an ominous croak
that should have completely cowed them, but didn’t.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Ronald with great interest. “What
will happen if we do? Do you not think, Donald, that she
looks like a witch?”</p>

<p>“Ou, aye,” declared Donald judiciously. “But we have
not seen her casting any spells yet. Can you cast spells,
Grannie Witchie?”</p>

<p>Kelpie’s amusement changed to apprehension as the
infuriated Mina spluttered speechlessly. It was probably
only her speechlessness and the timely arrival of Glenfern
that saved the twins from an awful fate. Mina gave them
one last baleful glare—Kelpie fervently hoped it wasn’t
the Evil Eye—and turned to the tall chieftain. Kelpie
glanced at him, and at Ian, Eithne, and Alex, who arrived
just then from down by the loch, and then stared sullenly
at the ground. She dared not look straight at them, for if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they were to read her eyes and guess how she felt, then
they would refuse to let her go, and so Mina’s curse would
be upon them. And now Kelpie found that her old misgivings
were justified. She had recklessly given her affection
and left herself vulnerable, so now she must suffer
the consequences. Angrily she promised herself never to
be so weak again.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Glenfern pleasantly at last. “And are
you leaving us, Kelpie?” She jerked her head, not looking
at him. “I am sorry to hear it,” he said gently, “for I think
you were happy here, and we have come to like you
well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kelpie!” Eithne protested, shrinking a little from
Mina and Bogle. “Can you not stay?”</p>

<p>“Och, you cannot go!” clamored the twins in outrage.
“Who will be telling us stories now?”</p>

<p>Kelpie scowled, chewed her lip, and wished herself a
thousand miles away. And worse was to come, for a brief
glance upward showed her that all of them, from Mina to
the twins, were on the verge of guessing her true feelings.
She tossed her head and gave a hard little laugh. “Och,
I’m away,” she said airily, “for I’ve bided too long in one
place.”</p>

<p>Glenfern was looking at her keenly. “You are welcome
to stay, you know,” he told her.</p>

<p>“Aye, to slave for you without pay!” whined Mina in
her most put-upon voice. If she had been slow to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
attack, she made up for it now. “We have come to have
her wages.”</p>

<p>From under her lashes Kelpie saw the hurt on Eithne’s
face, and something like pity on Ian’s. Only Alex wore a
look of acid amusement that set Kelpie’s teeth on edge.
And Glenfern was giving Mina the same stern look he
used when the twins had been naughty.</p>

<p>“I think you must be joking,” he said quietly. “We have
treated this lass far better than ever you have done. We
have fed her properly, clothed her in decent, clean garments,
taught her, given her affection and a roof over her
head and a bed under her. What have you ever given her
save harm and neglect?”</p>

<p>“She is ours!” Mina squealed angrily, but she must have
seen that she would get nowhere, for she suddenly
changed tactics. “Would you be wanting Mac Cailein
Mor to hear things about you?” she hinted softly. “Things
about how you are favoring King Charles, and what you
think of the Covenant, and your own son associating with
the King and bringing back messages from him, and from
Montrose as well, perhaps?”</p>

<p>There was only one way Mina could have learned these
things. Everyone looked at Kelpie, who stuck out her chin
and grinned brazenly. Ou, the wicked, careless tongue of
her, to be telling Mina that! Ian and Eithne were looking
as if she had slapped them. There was a smile on Alex’s
lean face and scorn in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so you have not really changed at all,” he observed
softly, and was surprised at the bitterness of his own disappointment.
After all, what else had he expected? But
his tongue went on scathingly. “Selfish, faithless, unscrupulous
you are and always will be. You could never
think of inconveniencing yourself for the good of another,
could you, Kelpie?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Kelpie defiantly, but the sweet face
of Wee Mairi was warm and mocking in her heart.</p>

<p>“Let be, Alex.” Ian sighed. “She cannot help it. There
was not enough time to change old habits.”</p>

<p>“Nor ever will be,” retorted Alex.</p>

<p>Kelpie hissed at him venomously. “Faithless yourself!”
she spat. “Do not be forgetting what I told you, Ian!” And
she turned away to Glenfern, who was laughing at Mina.</p>

<p>“By all means go to Argyll,” he said cheerfully. “Tell
him whatever you like. He knows well enough where our
sympathies lie. But leave the lass behind you when you
go, for I should not like her to be burned as a witch along
with the two of you. And now, farewell. I am sorry,” he
added, turning to Kelpie, “that you could not stay with us,
poor lass. Remember that we wish you well.”</p>

<p>That was really almost too much. Kelpie turned abruptly
and started up the pass with Mina and Bogle, who knew
when they were defeated. At least it was over, and she
must just put it away out of her memory.</p>

<p>But it was not quite over. Halfway up the hill a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
voice wailed after her. She turned to see Wee Mairi tugging
at Eithne’s hand, one small arm stretched out and
upward. “My Kelpie!” she shrilled. “Do not go away, my
Kelpie!”</p>

<p>Mina’s pale eyes were upon Kelpie, narrowed, watchful,
suspicious. Kelpie set her jaw, hardened her face, and
deliberately turned her back on the broken-hearted little
figure below.</p>

<p class="tb">The next few miles were blurred. Kelpie tramped mechanically
behind Mina and Bogle, unseeing, trying to
wipe three months out of her life and become the person
she had been before. Och, she had been right to begin
with! A feckless, foolish thing it was to care for anyone,
and only hurt could come from it. From now on she
would be hard as the granite sides of Ben Nevis, which
now loomed ahead, snow still patching its sheer northern
side. She would be what Alex thought her—and a pox
on him, too. Nor would she even care that he would strike
down that braw lad Ian, for Ian had had his warning,
and it was his own fault if he was too stupid to heed it.</p>

<p>Scowling, she kicked at an inoffensive clump of bluebells
and deliberately stepped on a wild yellow iris. She
would become a witch, then; not a “coven witch,” either.
She had seen them—silly people, who made a great ceremony
of selling their souls to the Devil and met in groups
of thirteen, called covens, and held Black Mass, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
did a great deal of wild dancing. Mina said these were
little more than playing at witchcraft and learned only a
few simple spells. No, now, Kelpie would be a witch of
the old sort, who needed no bargains with Satan, but who
tapped a Power that was old before the beginnings of
Christianity. A Power it was that could be used for either
black or white magic, but Kelpie had seen little of the
white, and black seemed much more congenial, especially
in her present mood.</p>

<p>She drifted into her old dream of what she would do
one day to Mina and Bogle. Aye, and perhaps she would
just add Alex as well. They were over the pass and heading
south along the side of Loch Lochy before she came
back to herself and began to wonder about the present.</p>

<p>“Where is it we are going now?” she demanded, moving
up to walk beside Mina, half off the narrow path. “When
will you be teaching me witchcraft? What are you planning?”</p>

<p>Mina cast a thoughtful eye at Kelpie’s blue dress, now
kilted up through her belt for easier walking. “I think that
would be fitting me,” she remarked casually. “We will
be telling you what you will need to know when it is the
right time for knowing it,” she added so mildly that Kelpie
looked at her with dark suspicion.</p>

<p>Falling behind once more, she began again to brood
over her life. It consisted of being pushed from one situation
into another. It was other folk who acted, and herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
who reacted, who was acted upon. Was she, then, such a
spineless creature? Was her whole life to be molded by
others? Rebellion once more rose in her, but then subsided
as she remembered the two-pronged stick that Mina held
over her—nay, three-pronged, really. She could curse
Kelpie, and she could curse Wee Mairi and Ian and the
other folk of Glenfern, and only Mina could teach Kelpie
witchcraft. And witchcraft, now, had become the only
goal in her life, the only hope of escaping the hateful
mastery of Mina and Bogle. Kelpie set her teeth, and the
look on her face was neither pleasant nor attractive.</p>

<p>Down to the tip of Loch Lochy and on down the river
they plodded, past the home of Glenfern’s chief, Lochiel;
and at last they made camp for the night in the old
unfinished castle of Inverlochy. Roofless it was, and built
four-square, with a round tower at each corner, and Kelpie
narrowed her eyes thoughtfully as they went in. Mina
and Bogle never looked for walls about them, except sometimes
in the cold of winter. What was afoot?</p>

<p>For the moment there was no time to wonder. Mina
nodded brusquely at the river, which flowed just outside
the arched stone entrance. “Gather us firewood,” she ordered,
“and then guddle us some fish—if you have not
forgotten how.” Her pale eyes rested again on Kelpie’s
dress, and Bogle chuckled.</p>

<p>An hour or so later, annoyed but not in the least astonished,
Kelpie wiped her greasy fingers on the dirty rags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which now covered her, and glowered across the fire at
Mina. The hag and the blue dress were more or less the
same size, but of far different shapes. The dress sagged
across the front of Mina’s hunched shoulders and strained
ominously across the back, and was at once too long and
too narrow in the waist, and the cuffs reached in vain for
those long bony wrists. Kelpie had a mental picture of
bright hazel eyes dancing in wicked amusement in an
angular red-topped face. For once she could have appreciated
Alex’s sense of humor, and her own white teeth
showed momentarily in a matching grin.</p>

<p>Mina glared at her suspiciously, and Kelpie hastily
stopped grinning. <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> Mina was almost as bad as Alex
himself at seeing what she shouldn’t! And she mustn’t
anger Mina too much—not yet! So she lowered her slanted
eyes more or less submissively and waited.</p>

<p>“Hah!” said Mina suddenly. “You think I am not knowing
what you are thinking?”</p>

<p>Kelpie devoutly hoped not. She had no desire to be
turned into a toad or something equally unpleasant. Best
to walk warily—neither too innocent nor too defiant.
“I am wondering what you are about,” she retorted sullenly.
“I have learned the things you were wanting me to,
but you have not told me why, nor have you taught me
any spells.”</p>

<p>“Hah!” said Mina again. “First we will read the crystal.”</p>

<p>And presently, under the ghost-light of the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
night, Kelpie sat again with her hand in Mina’s horny
claw and gazed into the blank crystal ball. It remained
still and empty. “I see myself,” invented Kelpie impudently.
“It is in a place that I have never been, and I am
wearing a blue dress—”</p>

<p>Mina turned on her in sudden suspicion, and Kelpie
prepared to duck. But they were distracted by a small
flicker of light that came from an upper window of one of
the castle towers. For an instant, fear gripped Kelpie.
Was it an uncanny creature of some sort? Then she noticed
that Bogle was nowhere in sight, and she chewed her lip
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Sure enough, presently his shadowy figure emerged
from the tower door. He came back to the fire and sat
down without a word. But Kelpie thought she had seen
him put something in his new leather sporran (recently
stolen, without doubt), and there passed between him
and Mina a long look and the tiniest of nods.</p>

<p>Kelpie pretended to notice nothing, but her mind was
busy. It couldn’t have been magic he was up to, for Bogle
did no magic except for ordinary curses. It must have been
a message, then—a message left for him here, and they
had known where to look for it. And that was why they
camped in the castle instead of out in the open.</p>

<p>Och, there was something in the air, indeed and indeed!
Kelpie went to sleep wondering what it might be—and
how she might be turning it to her own advantage.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_8">8. A Task for Kelpie</h2>

<p>From Inverlochy Castle they headed southeast, around
the tip of Loch Leven and into the lands of the Stewarts
of Glencoe. Now they definitely turned southward.
Kelpie frowned.</p>

<p>“Will we be going into Campbell country, then?” she
asked, faintly alarmed. For the last time they had ventured
into Argyll’s lands there had been an all too exciting witch
hunt from which they had barely escaped, so it must be
an important matter indeed that would bring Mina and
Bogle back again into danger.</p>

<p>Mina just grunted disagreeably, but by the next day
Kelpie’s question was answered, for they reached Loch
Etive, which was well into Campbell land. Mina glanced
around nervously, and Kelpie again wondered where they
were going, and why. Bogle stood for a moment, staring
down the loch, then turned and purposefully led the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to the precise spot where the River Etive entered the
northernmost tip. Clearly he knew exactly where he was
going. And then Kelpie saw what must be the reason for
this journey. A man sat waiting for them in a copse of
alder near the river, looking oddly out of place in the
sober gray breeches of a Lowlander.</p>

<p>“Aweel,” he said and looked at them. Kelpie’s sharp
eyes took in every detail of the stocky long-armed figure,
with sandy hair cropped to its ears, and sandy eyebrows
looking too thin for the broad face. She did not like what
she saw, and even less what she felt. For there was no
expression at all on the Lowlander’s face. His eyes were
like cold pebbles, and there was a malignance about him
that made her shrink inside.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kelpie knew that he must be a warlock. Mina
and Bogle would not be merely working with him; they
were under his orders. Probably it was he who was behind
Mina’s interest in politics, Kelpie’s long stay at Glenfern,
this hurried trip. Och, it was a powerful and evil man,
this, and she would do well to fear him.</p>

<p>The small opaque eyes studied her for a moment and
then turned to Mina, who looked small and shrunken
before them. “Is yon the lass?” Their owner demanded in
the burred English of Glasgow.</p>

<p>Mina nodded, and the eyes turned back to Kelpie.
“Come here!” he commanded.</p>

<p>Kelpie had a passionate desire to assert her own will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and refuse. But it would be daft to try to challenge his
power now—and especially with Mina and Bogle watching
her. Reluctantly, her own eyes smoldering with anger
and foreboding, she went and stood before him, and he
seemed to read her thoughts.</p>

<p>“So, ye’d like tae be a witch,” he said, his voice half a
sneer, half a caress. “Tae hae sich power, ye maun learn
tae obey. Obey! Ye didna ken that, eh? Weel—ailbins ye
can prove yersel’ the noo, and earn the powers ye’re
wanting.” He turned to Mina again. “Hae ye told her?”</p>

<p>Mina shook her head humbly. “Never a word.”</p>

<p>“Good. She’ll hear it the noo,” returned the Lowlander.
He turned back to Kelpie, whose small face regarded him
with wary intensity. His face became genial and fatherly.
“Ye’re a lucky lass,” he began, “tae hae us a’ so concerned
wi’ yer ain guid.”</p>

<p>Kelpie laughed aloud, and there was genuine amusement
as well as derision in her laughter. Did they think
her a bairn, and daft as well?</p>

<p>At once the Lowlander became brisk and businesslike.
Very well, then, he conceded, perhaps it was not merely
her own good they were after. But she would profit greatly.
Who, he demanded, was her worst enemy?</p>

<p>Kelpie prudently did not name Mina and Bogle. Instead,
she remembered Mina’s deep interest of late and made a
shrewd guess at the answer he expected. “Mac Cailein
Mor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aye, Argyll,” he said approvingly and went on to point
out why. The Kirk of the Covenant was reaching farther
and farther into the Highlands now, with its persecution
of honest witches, and even of stupid old folk who were
not witches at all, for that matter. And who was head of
the Covenant? Who was spearhead of the persecutions,
the pricking and torture and burnings? Argyll. If he was
not stopped, there would be no safe place in all Scotland
for such as they.</p>

<p>Kelpie nodded and found part of her mind thinking
that on this one point only—Argyll and the Covenant—did
her world and that of Glenfern agree.</p>

<p>Very well, then, the Lowlander continued. They must
take steps to destroy Argyll. And what better thing than
a hex? A wee image of him, in clay or wax, they would
make. And then they would stick pins in it, roast it, freeze
it, pour poison over it, and, by the black powers of witchcraft,
all these things would happen to Mac Cailein Mor
himself, until at last he would die in great pain.</p>

<p>Again Kelpie nodded warily. And how did she enter
into all this, at all?</p>

<p>She found out soon enough. In order to make a really
effective hex on Argyll, something from himself was
needed to mold into the wax figure—hair or fingernail
clippings, preferably. And who was to obtain them? Why,
Kelpie, of course.</p>

<p>Now it was clear why she had been left at Glenfern to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
learn the ways of gentry and how to be a servant. She
would hire herself as housemaid at Inverary Castle and,
as soon as she managed to get the hair or fingernail clippings,
just come away back here with them. And as a
reward she would be taught all she wished to know about
spells, potions, curses—even the Evil Eye itself.</p>

<p>As easy as that!</p>

<p>They were making her their tool again, of course, to
do what they dared not do themselves. If she were caught,
her life would not be worth a farthing. Still—Kelpie
thought quickly behind narrowed eyes and an impassive
face. It was a chance to get away from Mina and Bogle
and perhaps take a hand in managing her own life. Once
away in Inverary, she could decide whether or not to carry
out the errand. Perhaps she would prefer Mac Cailein Mor
to Mina and just stay for a while. Or perhaps.... Well,
she would see.</p>

<p>She listened with great docility as they explained how
she could get in touch with them once she had completed
her task. She even nodded when the Lowlander suggested
blandly that it might just be safest to send the hair—or
half of it—on to them by the messenger they would tell
her of, and then she herself could be bringing the rest
later. Kelpie kept a sneer from crossing her face. If they
thought her so witless as that, let them, then! But if and
when she came to them, it would be with the hair hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in a safe place, and they having to fulfill their part of the
bargain before they saw it.</p>

<p>The Lowlander was very pleased with her, and Kelpie
went to bed very pleased with herself. But she awoke near
dawn with the sense of something bothering her.</p>

<p>The sky was a vast aching void, neither black nor light.
The world was a great shadow. Kelpie crept silently away
from the camp and over the crest of the nearest rise, still
wrapped in the old woolen plaidie which served as cloak
and blanket. She seated herself against the thickness of a
rhododendron, so that she was lost in the black shadows
of its great leaves and blossoms. Then she stared down
along the long, steely sheet of Loch Etive and began to
think.</p>

<p>Obey, the Lowlander had said—and clearly Mina and
Bogle were obeying him. But Kelpie had thought that to
be a witch was to be free, to have power to command
others, never to <em>be</em> commanded again by anyone.</p>

<p>Was it not so, after all? Did the Lowlander, in turn,
obey someone—or Something? For an instant Kelpie
sensed something infinitely dangerous and horrible. Was
Satan merely another name for those ancient Dark Powers?
And was the price for invoking them to be a slave
to them? She shuddered, and cold droplets of sweat broke
out on her short upper lip.</p>

<p>Then she pulled herself together. She must not give in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to foolish worries. The Lowlander was a fearsome man,
but witchcraft was the only way to be free of Mina, and
when she had learned it she need fear neither of them any
longer.</p>

<p>All the same, the first seed of doubt had taken root, and
it no longer seemed quite so easy to become the most
powerful witch in Scotland. It was a rather subdued
Kelpie who meekly cooked the fish and oatcakes for breakfast,
bade the Lowlander farewell, and followed Bogle and
Mina on to Loch Awe.</p>

<p>At a ruined old shieling hut by the loch they stopped
and waited for a day, until there came a round-faced
young woman with a wealth of brown hair and a slate-colored
dress kilted up over a striped petticoat. She seemed
an unlikely person to be working with witches and warlocks,
for her bright-cheeked smile was quite artless.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhia dhuit!</i>” She beamed. “Is this the lass who will be
fetching the hair to hex Mac Cailein Mor, may the demons
fly away with him? I am Janet Campbell, who will take
you to Inverary. I will call you Sheena at once,” she added
chattily, “so you can get used to it, for Mrs. MacKellar
would never be hiring a lass named for a kelpie.” She
chuckled cheerfully.</p>

<p>Kelpie gave her an appraising look from under her thick
black lashes, but Janet didn’t seem in the least put out.
“I could not be doing the task myself,” she explained, “for
I have my work, and no reason to be going into the castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
And,” she added forthrightly, “I am not brave or clever
enough. But I will be your messenger, Sheena, when you
need me.”</p>

<p>Kelpie, more and more resentful of being used by
others, nodded sullenly. But Janet’s next words cheered
her considerably.</p>

<p>“She cannot be asking for work in such rags,” pointed
out that young woman matter-of-factly. “They would
know her for a gypsy at once, and Mac Cailein Mor has
a fearful hatred of such. Best be giving her your blue
dress to wear, Mina.”</p>

<p>Bogle chuckled, and Kelpie hid her satisfaction behind
a blank face. Mina snarled and gave in. The string of
epithets she flung at Kelpie along with the dress hardly
amounted to an objection at all, and Kelpie’s earlier misgivings
rose again briefly. If even the formidable Mina
was so meekly obeying, then what power this Lowlander
must have!</p>

<p>She was still brooding on this as she and Janet set out
on the last bit of the journey, her cheek still stinging from
Mina’s farewell cuff. On down Loch Awe, and to the
wild steepness of Glen Aray, and along that gash in the
hills toward Loch Fyne, Janet led the way sturdily enough,
although Kelpie’s wiry legs could have gone much faster.
Part of the time Janet left the thin path altogether and
threaded her way along the slopes, among great clumps
of brilliant pink rhododendron, groves of oak and hazel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and rowan, patches of lavender-blooming heath and the
mystic white bog-cotton.</p>

<p>“Best not to risk meeting anyone,” she remarked with
a trace of nervousness. “I dare not be seen with you, in
case....”</p>

<p>She left the sentence unfinished and went on in a new
and brisk voice. “Now I will be giving you your story to
tell the housekeeper when you ask for work. You are
Sheena Campbell, daughter to Sorcha and Seumas, who
lived in the old shieling hut where we met on Loch Awe.
When they died, you went in service with MacIntyre of
Craignish, but now, with their daughter wedded and
away, there is no need for you. So you have come to Inverary,
to your own clan chief, to see is there a place for
you.”</p>

<p>For the next two hours she fed Kelpie the details of her
fictional life and made her repeat them over and over,
until Kelpie almost felt that she was two people at once.</p>

<p>“Och, you’re glib, just!” said Janet at last, her round
face admiring. “I’m almost believing you myself. ’Tis a
clever mind you have, and a canny tongue.” She stopped
and turned around to survey Kelpie’s face searchingly.
“Aye,” she went on, “and your face, though it is not bonnie,
just, is a face to beguile the lads. Have you a braw laddie
who loves you, Sheena?”</p>

<p>Four months ago Kelpie would have jeered at her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wonder and scorn. What had the lass of Mina and Bogle
to do with love, or lads either—save to sell love-charms
to the foolish? But though there had been no talk or
thought of romance at Glenfern (except on one teasing
afternoon), some sleeping thing in Kelpie had, perhaps,
begun to stir. The face of Ian leaped into her mind, with
the fine dark eyes of him, and the sensitive mouth curving
downward and then up; and then she felt the strange,
warm-faced sensation of her first blush—and she felt again
the pain of her departure from Glenfern.</p>

<p>“No!” She spat so violently that Janet raised her eyebrows
and gave Kelpie another sharp glance before she
turned to walk on.</p>

<p>“A pity, that,” she observed mildly. “And a great waste,”
she added presently, with a catch to her voice. “Had I
your face and tongue, I would not be in the service of
witchcraft, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Kelpie kilted up her blue dress a bit higher and came
even with Janet so that she could see her face. “Why are
you?” she demanded curiously. “I think you could never
be a witch.”</p>

<p>“Och, no!” agreed Janet instantly. “At first I was only
wanting a wee bit of a love potion to win the heart of the
lad I loved. But before it could start to work at all, Mac
Cailein Mor took him into the army and off to raid the
MacDonalds. Och, my braw Angus.” She whimpered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was killed?” Kelpie asked, and tried to push down
the sympathy in her voice. She had promised herself not
to care for anyone again, but only for herself.</p>

<p>“It was Mac Cailein Mor had him shot,” said Janet
tonelessly. “He tried to save an old woman from the house
they were burning. And for that I will help the Devil himself
to destroy Mac Cailein Mor, my chief though he be.
I am afraid of yon Lowlander, for he is evil, but I hate Mac
Cailein Mor more than I fear the Lowlander.</p>

<p>“You must be very canny, Sheena! If you are caught—”
She shuddered. “Have you a <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i>?”</p>

<p>Kelpie nodded and drew the small sheathed knife from
inside her dress. Janet looked at it somberly. “If you’re
caught, you’d do well to use it on yourself. ’Twould save
you torment and burning, more than likely, and keep you
from betraying the rest of us. You’ll say no word, ever,
about me, Sheena? Pretend you have never seen or heard
of me! Promise, Sheena!”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked at her, and Janet’s eyes were humble and
pleading. “I know I am a coward,” Janet whispered, “but
I cannot help it. I could not bear the pain, and I would
not dare to kill myself—but you would, for you are brave.”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked at her <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> reflectively. It was the
finest one she had ever had, the one stolen last spring in
Inverness. The wee flat scabbard was darkly carved, and
the four-inch blade, when she drew it out, winked sharply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the sun. Would she use it on herself? she wondered.
Did she dare?</p>

<p>The beauty of the Highlands shimmered around her in
pure, clear colors never quite the same from one instant
to the next. The sky was infinite and tender; the sun beat
warmly on her head; the air was delight to breathe. The
world was good—except for the people in it, defiling it
with hate and greed. It would be a pity to die, a waste of
living. She found it very difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>She looked again at the gleaming edge of the <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i>,
frowning a little. Dare? Yes, she thought she would dare,
if it was to escape torture and burning. That would not
take much courage. On the contrary, it would be the easy
way—and she found that she did not like the taste of the
idea. A feeling within her protested that suicide was
shabby, debasing, a cheating of oneself. But Kelpie, who
had never been taught such things as morals and integrity,
could find no words and no reasons for this feeling. She
shrugged and put the <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> back. Time enough to
think about it if the occasion came up.</p>

<p>Janet had been watching her with round eyes, guessing
a little of her thought. She shivered slightly. “You are very
brave,” and said again. “I think you will be getting away
with the hair. And I am sure that whatever is happening
at all, you will not speak any names.”</p>

<p>Kelpie fell back a step or two. She looked thoughtfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
on a golden patch of gorse blanketing the hillside ahead,
and her smile was very pointed. No, she would not betray
Janet—not, she reminded herself, because she was
softhearted, but only because it would not help herself.
But—if she was so unlucky as to be caught, which she
did not at all intend to be—she would be very happy
indeed to tell Mac Cailein Mor all about Mina, Bogle, and
the Lowlander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_9">9. Inverary Castle</h2>

<p>Loch Fyne stretched long and narrow between its hills—as
what Highland loch did not? Glen Aray opened
out into a meadow there, where the river entered the
loch, and from the top of her hill Kelpie had a fine and
leisurely view. There was the town of Inverary on the far
side, nestled right on the loch. And on this side, almost
below her, rose the massive stone bulk and towers of
Inverary Castle, home of Mac Cailein Mor.</p>

<p>Kelpie wriggled a little deeper into her nest of tall
harebells and broom and stared down at it with interest.
She had time to wait and think. Janet had braided the
black hair neatly for her, used the hem of her own dress
to wash Kelpie’s grimy pointed face, and then hurried on
to the head of the loch. From there she would return to
the village as if from her own home. And Kelpie was to
bide here, out of sight, until the next day, and then come
down from the glen. Kelpie had agreed willingly enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
not for Janet’s sake, but for one more night under the
free sky.</p>

<p>She glowered at the brooding gray castle, for it was just
occurring to her that it would be much more like a prison
than Glenfern. And would they allow her to be out and
away in the hills when her tasks were done, as she had
done at Glenfern? She doubted it. Och, it was a great
sacrifice she was making for those who had sent her, and
she must see that her reward was as great. And then....
She drifted into her favorite daydream.</p>

<p>In the long white twilight she backed down the hill
until she found a tarn sheltered by birch, and settled herself
for the night. The Dancers were absent tonight, and
the sky a pale shadowed silver in which only the largest
stars flickered feebly, for it was midsummer. Then the
moon came over the crest of the hill, and there were no
more stars, and the tarn became a pool of cold light.
Deliberately Kelpie leaned over the bank and stared into
the tarn.</p>

<p>The reflected brilliance of moonlight glowed, closed in
upon itself, became a silver point, and then in its place
there was a strange land—a place with giant forests, dark
and wild, and a crude house made of logs in a rough
clearing. She tossed her head with annoyance. What was
this to her? What of her future, her career as a witch?
What of destruction of those she hated? What of her
enemies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The tarn obeyed, as if with a malicious will of its own,
and she saw Argyll’s face, the eyes coldly burning, the
mouth twisted in anger, staring straight at her, and in her
mind’s ear Kelpie heard the word “witch.”</p>

<p>She threw herself backward and sat with beating heart
for several moments after the water stood clear and blank.
Was she fey, then? Was it her own doom she was seeing?
Och, no, perhaps not. For she had not seen herself, and
surely Mac Cailein Mor had looked so to many a person
accused of witchcraft. She had asked to see her enemy,
and the picture was telling her, just, that here was a
dangerous enemy—a warning to be canny, that was all.
She curled up comfortably in a patch of rank grass free
of nettles, and slept.</p>

<p class="tb">In the thin light of morning she smoothed back her hair
and washed her face in the cold, peaty water of the tarn.
Then, wary but confident, she made her way back to the
glen and along the river to the castle.</p>

<p>As she approached the massive stone gateway, Kelpie
put on the proper face and attitude for this occasion as
easily as Eithne might have put on a different frock. The
task was not so easy, really, for there was little that could
be done about the long slanted eyes and brows or the
pointed jaw. But the severely braided hair helped, and by
tucking in her lower lip and drooping the corners she
added a helpless and wistful note. She pulled her chin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
down and back and pressed her elbows to her sides for a
look of brave apprehension, and then she changed her
free, fawnlike walk for a most sober one.</p>

<p>Through the gate she stepped into a subdued world of
drab colors. Her blue dress looked insolently bright beside
the grays and blacks of the other women in the courtyard.
Only the tartan—that proud symbol of the Highlander—had
failed to be extinguished by the decree of the Covenant
and Kirk. And even the tartans, being colored with
vegetable dye, were of muted shades.</p>

<p>A man leading a horse stopped and regarded her with
little approval. “What is it that you are wanting?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Could I be seeing Mrs. MacKellar, the housekeeper?”
asked Kelpie, her eyes lowered modestly.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment and then called over
his shoulder, “Siubhan, the lass is wanting Mrs. MacKellar.
Take her away up to the door.” And he went on about his
business.</p>

<p>A sad-faced woman put down her basket of laundry,
regarded Kelpie without curiosity, and jerked her head.
Kelpie followed with great meekness and waited obediently
at the castle door until Siubhan had gone inside and
reappeared with a tall, gaunt woman in black.</p>

<p>Once again there was the disapproving look. “And who
may you be?”</p>

<p>“I be Sheena Campbell.” Kelpie launched into her story,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
not too glibly, with downcast eyes and humble voice.
“And it’s hoping I am to serve Mac Cailein Mor,” she
finished earnestly.</p>

<p>“Mmmm,” commented Mrs. MacKellar. “We’ve lasses
aplenty in Inverary Village.”</p>

<p>“Och,” protested Kelpie, “but ’tis experience I’ve had!
And,” she added pitifully, “they will be having homes, and
I with nowhere to turn.”</p>

<p>Mrs. MacKellar softened, but only slightly. “To tell
the truth,” she said bluntly, “there is something—I’m not
altogether liking the look of you! How am I knowing you
are what you say?”</p>

<p>“But and whyever else would I be coming to Mac Cailein
Mor?” demanded Kelpie artlessly.</p>

<p>“Mmmm, that will be the question,” retorted Mrs. MacKellar.
“No, now, I’m thinking—”</p>

<p>What she thought was never said, for from the corner
of her eye Kelpie saw a tall figure just passing the foot of
the stairs—not Argyll, but his tallness, his long face, red
hair, and manner of dress suggested that he must be
Argyll’s son. Kelpie took a chance.</p>

<p>She turned away blindly from the imminent refusal,
carefully stumbled a bit, and tumbled herself neatly
down the steps to land in a pathetic heap in front of the
startled young man.</p>

<p>“My sorrow!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Kelpie swiftly decided against being injured, as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
might prove inconvenient. So she gave a small scared
glance upward at the faint frown above her and shrank
back against the wall. “Och, your pardon!” she whispered.
“Please do not be beating me!”</p>

<p>The young man—she was quite sure now that he must
be Lord Lorne, son of Argyll—gave a short laugh. “Whatever
you may have heard, I am no beater of bairns.”</p>

<p>Kelpie drooped her lip at him. “Sir, I would not mind
a beating, if only I could be staying here to work for Mac
Cailein Mor.”</p>

<p>“What is this? Who is she?” Lord Lorne switched to
English, and Mrs. MacKellar replied in the same tongue.</p>

<p>“She iss saying her name iss Sheena Campbell from
Loch Awe, and that she iss an orphan who hass peen
working in the home of MacIntyre of Craignish who iss
not needing her any more.” Mrs. MacKellar’s English,
sibilant with the soft Gaelic sounds, was really not nearly
as good as Kelpie’s—but Kelpie was careful to keep her
face blank, as if she did not understand. “But sir,” went
on the housekeeper, “I am not liking the look of her whateffer.
Her eyes—”</p>

<p>Lord Lorne bent and looked at them. Kelpie tried to
make them wide and pleading.</p>

<p>“Oddly ringed, aren’t they?” he observed. “Well, she
can’t help that. You could use her, I think. Why not try
her out?” And he went on to wherever he had been going.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Seadh.</i>” Mrs. MacKellar shrugged and washed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
hands of the decision. “You can be staying a bit, then,
until I see can you do the work. We will see does Peigi
have an old dress you can be wearing, of a proper color.
You’re of the Kirk, are you no?” she demanded suddenly,
turning to cast a suspicious eye on the blue of Kelpie’s
dress.</p>

<p>Kelpie wasn’t quite sure what that meant, and, even
with Janet’s tutoring, she dared not bluff too far. She
took an instant to think as she rose slowly to her feet.
“I am wanting to be a better Christian,” she said, temporizing,
with an earnest face. “And that is one reason I was
coming here, for the house of Mac Cailein Mor is surely
the most godly of all.”</p>

<p>“Well—” Mrs. MacKellar looked somewhat appeased.
“Come away in, then.” And Kelpie came.</p>

<p class="tb">Life in Inverary Castle was quite different from life at
Glenfern, even though Kelpie’s duties were similar. There
was a coldness here—and not only physical, although the
castle was chill enough, with draughts constantly blowing
down the halls and pushing out against the wall tapestries.
But the chill of spirit was even more depressing. Laughter
was near sacrilege, and a smile darkly suspect. Dancing
simply didn’t exist, and singing was confined to dour
hymns regarding hellfire and damnation. If Kelpie had
ever chafed at the restrictions of Glenfern, she now realized
what a free and happy life that had been. Och, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
people could live like this! Worse, that they seemed to
approve it! One could hardly say they <em>liked</em> anything.</p>

<p>And here Kelpie heard the other viewpoint regarding
Mac Cailein Mor. Everyone seemed to fear him, even his
rather mousy wife and sullen son. But they also saw him
(except possibly Lord Lorne) as the Right Hand of God,
fighting the battles of righteousness against such enemies
of Heaven as witches, King Charles, Papists, Anglicans,
everyone else who was not of the Covenant, and, most
particularly, Lord Graham of Montrose, who was supposedly
leading the King’s army in Scotland. But no one
seemed to know where Montrose was now, at all. He had
started north to raise an army for the king and then vanished
altogether, and it was to be fondly hoped that the
Devil had snatched him away to Hell where he belonged.</p>

<p>Kelpie listened and said nothing. She didn’t like what
she heard and began to hate Argyll on her own account.
Indeed and it was true that he would take all freedom
from all people if he could. Kelpie cared little enough
about anyone else, she told herself, but her own freedom
mattered more than anything at all, and she began to feel
a personal enthusiasm for her task here. A hex was what
he deserved, and she hoped that the Lowlander would
make it a fine horrible one indeed.</p>

<p>It was lucky, she discovered, that himself was home at
all now, for he spent much of his time these days heading
his Covenant army, raiding the Highlands, and occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
daring a small skirmish with other enemies. (Kelpie
received the impression that he was not, perhaps, the
boldest and most audacious leader when it came to fighting.)
But now he was home, as no doubt the Lowlander
had known.</p>

<p>Still, three bleak weeks had passed, and she still had
never had a chance to lay her hands on any bit of his
person or even come near his private rooms. Mrs. MacKellar
kept a watchful eye out, and Kelpie’s duties were
confined to all wings of the castle but that of Mac Cailein
Mor. And so she watched and waited through June, tense,
wary, inwardly chafing.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_10">10. A Bit of Hair</h2>

<p>It was an impossible errand they had sent her on! Kelpie
realized it slowly, angrily. A bit of Argyll’s hair, indeed
and indeed! Nobody at all would be so feckless as to
leave a bit of his hair lying about, convenient to the hand
of any witch who happened to be passing. And how much
less Mac Cailein Mor, who was thrice as crafty, ten times
as suspicious, and a thousand times more hated than most
folk? Och, no; for him such carelessness would be altogether
impossible. It was certain that he would stand over
his barber while every last hair or fingernail clipping was
safely burned. The best she could hope for was a bit of
his personal belongings, which would be much less effective;
and whatever Mina and the Lowlander would say
she did not know. No doubt they would make an excuse
to refuse to teach her spells, after all.</p>

<p>And so she seethed under the joyless Covenant mask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which was becoming harder and harder to wear. How she
longed for the freedom of the open! Her legs ached with
the longing to run and leap and dance upon the hills, and
her face ached with the need to laugh. And yet she stayed
on, hoping for some miracle, reflecting sourly that Mrs.
MacKellar and Argyll were very little improvement over
Mina and Bogle.</p>

<p>It was in mid-July that it happened, during morning
prayer.</p>

<p>Kelpie knelt with the rest of the household on the cold
stone floor in grim endurance, for this long, twice-daily
torment was nearly unbearable for an active young gypsy.</p>

<p>Her place was in the very back, among the meanest of
the servants. Ahead, the bowed backs graduated in rank,
with Mrs. MacKellar far up front, just behind meek Lady
Argyll, Lord Lorne, and Ewen Cameron, whose red kilt
blazed sharply alien amid all the blue and green of the
Campbell tartan. And before them all stood Mac Cailein
Mor’s long, stooped figure, telling of the anger, jealousy,
cruelty of a God who could surely have nothing to do
with the opal world outside. With cold satisfaction and
in grim detail he described God’s will (which seemed indistinguishable
from Argyll’s will); and his pale eyes were
most disconcerting, for if one seemed fixed upon Siubhan
or Peigi, the other seemed to stare straight at Kelpie, and
who was to know what himself was really looking at,
whatever?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel, with wrath
and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to
destroy the sinners thereof out of it,” said Argyll. “He shall
destroy the minions of Satan, those evildoers who are not
of the Kirk, who blasphemously question the Covenant.
For all those who are not with the Covenant are against
the Lord and vile in His sight. They shall burn forever
in Hell, and above all shall burn all witches and that
servant of the Devil, Montrose. They shall be tormented—”</p>

<p>Kelpie felt the presence of the messenger in the open
door behind her, but dared not turn to look. She saw Argyll’s
eye flicker briefly in that direction and noticed the slight
pause before he went coldly on with his orders to and
from God. And something inside Kelpie stirred, and she
knew that something was about to happen which would
be important to her.</p>

<p>Dropping her dark head over clasped hands in an attitude
of great reverence, she tried to think what it could
be. There was nothing she had done. Unless—Had Ewen
Cameron said something about yesterday?</p>

<p>For yesterday Kelpie had found her first opportunity
to get away over to the wing which held the chambers of
Mac Cailein Mor and his family. She had actually reached
his door, and as she hesitated there, heart beating quickly,
another door nearby had opened, and through it came
a lad of about fifteen.</p>

<p>Kelpie had not needed to look at the oddness of a Cameron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
tartan in the Campbell stronghold to know that this
was Ewen, the grandson of Lochiel. Ian had told her
about him, and she had seen him now and again about the
castle. And Peigi had told her proudly how fine it was that
Mac Cailein Mor was taking on himself the education of
his nephew, for fear it should be neglected or his own
family should teach him to believe the wrong things.</p>

<p>Kelpie had hidden a cynical smile at the time, but now,
when the grave, clear-eyed lad stood regarding her in the
hall, she wondered briefly how much this “education”
would really mean. For he had about him the air of one
with a mind of his own.</p>

<p>“You’ll be Sheena, will you not?” he asked as Kelpie
belatedly made a stiff bob. She nodded. “Best not to linger
here,” he went on. “If my uncle should see you—”</p>

<p>“Aye,” Kelpie had murmured, and slipped away back
to her own territory with the odd feeling that he had seen
through her mask—not, perhaps, that he knew exactly
what was under it, but that he knew she was alien to this
world of Inverary.</p>

<p>Could he have said anything, just? Kelpie wondered as
she shifted her knees ever so slightly on the painfully hard
stone. The thing inside said no. He was another of those
strange people, like Ian and Eithne, who seemed not to
hate anyone or even wish them ill.</p>

<p>But still, something was about to happen, and she must
find out as soon as ever she could. When prayers were over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and the household rose and respectfully made way for
himself to go out first, it was easy enough for her to slip
nearest the door, for she had had a wealth of experience
at picking pockets and melting through crowds. And so
she saw the travel-weary messenger waiting outside, and
heard the news when Argyll did.</p>

<p>“Antrim of Colonsay and his clan of Irish MacDonalds
have landed at Ardnaburchen and taken the castle of
Mingary, and will even now be taking the keep of Lochaline,
your Lordship!”</p>

<p>The Marquis of Argyll said something under his breath,
and the freckles suddenly stood out under the red hair
that Kelpie coveted. “May the Devil take his impudence!”
he said aloud, and there was no doubt that he meant it
literally.</p>

<p>Kelpie tried to remember something she had heard at
Glenfern. Antrim—Colkitto, they called him—was chief
of a branch of MacDonalds that the Campbells had driven
westward, over the islands, and at last to Ireland. And now,
it seemed, he had decided to bring his clan back to Scotland
to fight the Campbells and perhaps take back some
land.</p>

<p>“Have messengers ready to ride,” Argyll said viciously
to his son. “I’ll have the army up and wipe him out once
and for all!” By this time the rest of the household had
filtered out into the hall, and it didn’t seem to matter if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
they all heard or no. But then, there’d be no keeping this
kind of news secret, whatever.</p>

<p>Kelpie clenched her fists. We? Then would Mac Cailein
Mor be away with the army himself?</p>

<p>“Isn’t there an English Parliament garrison at Carlisle?”
ventured Lord Lorne in English. “Why not send to them to
take warships up the coast? If they captured Antrim’s
ships, there’d be no retreat for him.”</p>

<p>Argyll nodded brusquely and strode off toward his
chambers to write the necessary letters—taking his hair
with him, of course. “Get my things ready to ride,” he ordered
one of his retainers, thus destroying Kelpie’s last
hope.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” she muttered, without changing the blank and
sober expression considered suitable for God-fearing
people. Whatever could she be doing now, at all, with him
away?</p>

<p>Impulsively, she slipped out of the hall before Mrs.
MacKellar or Peigi should see her, and made her way to
the tower next to Argyll’s wing. There she hid her thin
self partway up the steep, twisting stairs, where with one
eye she could see his door, and waited. Not that he would
be likely to be trimming his hair or fingernails now, but
perhaps in the flurry of his leaving she could just slip in
and lay hold of some wee personal item to be used instead,
and it the best she could do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a full half-hour before Argyll’s door opened.
Kelpie glimpsed the full tartan folds of his belted plaid
and then pressed herself out of sight as the halting steps
assured her that it was indeed Mac Cailein Mor.</p>

<p>She waited until they had passed down the hall and out
of hearing, and then slipped out of the tower and across
to the massive oaken door. She paused an instant, hand
lifted to open the door, but it was almost certain there
could be no one else in there, for the entire household
had been at morning prayer, and no one else had gone
in. The door opened heavily, with never a creak, and
closed firmly behind her.</p>

<p>Here must be his Lordship’s private withdrawing room.
Kelpie had never seen such a room, and she glanced
around with interest. The clan crest, a boar’s head, was
carved over the large stone fireplace and on the back of
the high oaken settle that stood at one wall. A bulky armchair
with a triangular seat going to a point in back stood
by a long table on which quills, ink, sand, and paper still
stood. But there was nothing personal. His bedroom must
be on through that other door.</p>

<p>She darted across the room silently, opened the door,
and saw an enormous four-post bedstead of inlaid walnut—a
fine piece indeed, she thought cynically, for an unworldly
Covenanter! No less than three great-chests doubtless
held his clothing and perhaps Lady Argyll’s—but
clothing would be too bulky for Kelpie’s needs. A plaid-brooch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
might just do nicely, though, and they should be
in a cupboard, perhaps, or a wee box somewhere.</p>

<p>Kelpie began investigating. And then she nearly yelped
with triumph. A brush! A brush in which were tangled
several long strands of red hair! Och, and he <em>had</em> been
careless, then, perhaps with being upset from the news of
Antrim. Och, the fine luck of it! Chuckling, she pulled
them loose, looked around for something to wrap them in—and
saw the bedroom door swing inexorably open.</p>

<p>There he stood, Mac Cailein Mor, one eye regarding her
balefully, the other apparently fixed on the wall behind;
and the thin lips were pitiless. For once Kelpie’s quick
mind and glib tongue failed her altogether, and she just
stood there while he crossed the room in three strides
and seized her wrist.</p>

<p>“A thief, is it?” he rasped.</p>

<p>Kelpie found her wits. “Och, no, your worship!” she
cried. “I know it’s no right I have to be coming here, but
it’s the fine and godly man you are, and leaving now, and
I just wanting to see—”</p>

<p>He pried her hand roughly open, and the damning
evidence of the hairs lay exposed on her palm.</p>

<p>“A witch!” he said with savage glee. “A witch in my own
household. Ah, the Devil is trying hard to destroy me, for
I do the work of the Lord. Blessed are those who are
persecuted for Thy name’s sake. Spawn of Satan, do you
know what we do with witches?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Witches?” faltered Kelpie with desperate innocence,
though she knew by now that pretense was hopeless. Far
less evidence than this would have been fatal, and even
with a much less suspicious man than Mac Cailein Mor.
Sudden hot anger almost drove out her terror for an instant—not
so much at Argyll as at Mina and Bogle and the
Lowlander, who had so callously sent her on this errand.
They had surely known how slim her chances were, and
that she would almost certainly be caught and burned.
And they would never have taught her the Evil Eye, even
had she been successful. She had been their tool and
cat’s-paw, and she cursed herself for being such a fool.
Och, she would see to it before she died that Argyll knew
their names and the meeting place.</p>

<p>She didn’t once think of the <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> that rested within
the bodice of her sober gray dress.</p>

<p>Mac Cailein Mor was dragging her out of the room,
baying for his servants, the dangerous hairs safely in his
own hand. Kelpie submitted passively because it would
do no good at all to struggle. Her mind darted here and
there, like a moth in a glass ball, finding no way out at
all.</p>

<p>And now all the household was running, and two husky
men took her from Argyll and hustled her brutally through
the castle and out to the courtyard, while Argyll sputtered
his tale to his son between bellows for Mrs. MacKellar.</p>

<p>“Was it you hired her?” he demanded ominously of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
cringing housekeeper. “Could you not see the eyes of her,
the teeth, the brows? Or was it yourself plotting against
me too? Are the minions of Satan filling my own home?”
He was working himself into a fine frenzy, and even
through her terror Kelpie found time to wonder briefly at
the idiotic honesty of Lorne, who spoke up then.</p>

<p>“’Twas my fault, Father. Mrs. MacKellar didn’t like
the look of the lass when she came to ask for employment,
and I was fool enough to feel sorry for her, and I said to
take her in.” He met his sire’s black glare straight. “’Twas
stupid,” he said firmly, “but no plot against you by any
here.”</p>

<p>“The Devil addled your wits, then,” retorted Argyll, not
to be deprived of his martyrdom. “Could you not see the
ringed eyes of her? No, do not look into them! She’ll cast
a spell!” He glared at Lorne, and then, dourly, at Ewen
Cameron, who stood near with an expressionless face.</p>

<p>Kelpie was again fervently wishing that she <em>could</em> cast
a spell! Och, the plague she would be putting on the lot
of them, and himself in particular! Since she couldn’t, she
tucked in her lower lip, lowered the offensive eyes, hung
meekly in the painful grip on her arms, and made one
last hopeless try for her life.</p>

<p>“What was it I was doing wrong?” she whimpered. “It
was nothing valuable I was taking, but only a wee bit
token to protect me from the Devil whilst yourself was
away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no use at all. Everyone knew what hairs were
used for, even children.</p>

<p>“Shall we burn her now, Mac Cailein Mor?” asked one
of the men. Kelpie’s heart thudded sickly. But Argyll
brooded.</p>

<p>“No time now,” he said reluctantly. “I’ll be wanting to
test her for witch marks and get a full confession and the
names of her accomplices. And there’s Antrim to deal with
first.” He looked frustrated at having to delay, and Kelpie
realized that here was a man who enjoyed cruelty for its
own sake. She shuddered.</p>

<p>“Put her in the dungeon,” ordered Argyll, “the wee cell
at the bottom, and with no blanket. And let no one open
the door or speak to her until I return. Put bread and water
through the grate, but nothing else. Is everything ready,
Buchanan? My horse, then.”</p>

<p>He turned away, and Kelpie drew a small shaky breath.
A wee respite, then, and perhaps a chance to escape altogether
from the torture and burning, if they didn’t search
her and take away the <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i>—and if she made up her
mind to use it.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_11">11. Argyll’s Dungeon</h2>

<p>The cell was tiny, damp, cold, and inconceivably
black. Within ten minutes after the solid door thudded
behind her, Kelpie was cowering on the floor. Even an
ordinary roof was oppressive to her, and this—Ou, the
dark and the smallness were almost tangible things that
seemed to press down and in on her, smothering and
squashing! It was even hard to breathe, just with the
thinking of it.</p>

<p>By the time half an hour had passed, it was all she could
do not to shriek wildly and beat her head against the stone.
She gritted her teeth, sensing that self-control was her
only hold on sanity. How could mere darkness hurt the
eyes so? Kelpie began fingering her <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> longingly.
It was escape, escape from this torment and that to follow.
She had no great fear of death, in spite of all she had
heard of Hell, for at worst it was almost certain to be interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet, the thing inside would not let her use the wee
sharp dagger that nestled so temptingly in her hand. It
gave no reason, except that this was a mean and shabby
way to die.</p>

<p>For nearly the first time in her memory, Kelpie cried.
On and on she sobbed, for as space was closing in on her,
time was stretched into a long and empty void, and she
was alone in chaos and terror.</p>

<p>Once she thought that perhaps if she did kill herself
now, her Hell would be an eternity of this, and she shuddered
at the thought. Argyll’s God might just do such a
thing, and Satan’s fire was surely to be preferred—but
which of them would be having the decision, at all? Her
thoughts blurred off into confusion.</p>

<p>Some time later a grate in the door opened, a hand
pushed a bit of bread through the pale oblong, and it
clanged shut again. Kelpie roused herself to explore the
spot with her long, sensitive fingers but found it small and
solidly bolted. She took a few halfhearted bites of bread
and lapsed again into a shivering huddle.</p>

<p>After more time she drifted up from a semi-sleep to
hear another sound at the door. Was it the next day, then,
and time for more bread?</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> The door was opening, when Mac Cailein Mor had
ordered against it! Was he back, then? She shrank against
the wall as an oblong of gray spread like a shaft of light
into the thick black of the cell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sheena?”</p>

<p>It was Ewen Cameron! She knew the voice of him!</p>

<p>“Sheena, are you awake?”</p>

<p>With a small gasp, Kelpie was at the door. “Och, it’s
near dead I am! Will you no let me free? You wouldn’t
see me burned, an innocent wee lass, and put to torment
before it? I’ll—”</p>

<p>“Hist!” There was a hint of strain in his voice, with a
thread of humor around it. “And what were you thinking
I came for? ’Tis quite likely you <em>are</em> a witch,” he added
ruefully, “but for all that, I cannot abide cruelty. Come
away, then, and like a mouse.”</p>

<p>Gasping with relief, Kelpie was out of the door before
he had finished speaking. He groped to find her face in
the dark that was to her almost light. “Wait, now. I must
be bolting the door again. I cannot see.”</p>

<p>Kelpie moved beside him and helped. “Follow me,” he
said when it was done. “I can put you outside the walls,
and then ’tis up to you.”</p>

<p>It was all she asked. Scarcely able to believe her good
fortune, she followed him through a dark, narrow labyrinth
of stone corridors, most of them damp with being underground.
Twice he unlocked doors for them to pass through,
and finally they crept on hands and knees through a tunnel
quite as black as her cell had been. It twisted on and on,
and finally upward.</p>

<p>“’Tis an escape route in case of siege by an enemy,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Ewen explained over his shoulder. “None but the family is
supposed to know of it, and even they have nearly forgotten
it, because for the last hundred years Clan Campbell has
been too strong to be attacked in its own stronghold. Instead,
it is they who attack other clans.”</p>

<p>The narrow tunnel picked up the faint note of anger in
his voice, magnified and echoed it. Kelpie, engrossed
though she was in her own important affairs, suddenly
wondered how it felt to be fostered by a wicked uncle
who was, in addition, enemy to one’s own clan, and to know
you were being used as a hostage to control the actions
of your own grandfather, your own people. It was the first
time Kelpie had seriously tried to put herself into the
mind of another person, and it felt most peculiar and disturbing.</p>

<p>“What if real war is coming to the Highlands?” she
demanded. “Will Lochiel dare call out the Camerons
to fight against your uncle and the Covenant, or—”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence in which their small scufflings
seemed to shout aloud. Then: “Grandfather will dare to
do what is right,” said Ewen tersely.</p>

<p>Another silence, and then his low voice reached back to
her again, strongly earnest. “There are things more important
than safety, Sheena. I wonder if you know about
them. Was it for a principle you were wanting to put a
hex on my uncle, or for something else?”</p>

<p>Kelpie didn’t answer this, for the simple reason that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was not at all sure what a principle was. Unless—Could
it have anything to do with not using the <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> on
herself when it seemed much easier to do so? Or had she
not used it because the thing inside her had known that
she was going to be rescued? Och, it was much too confusing
to bother with now, for she could at last see a pale
blob of night sky ahead.</p>

<p>They emerged in a shallow cave on the hill above Inverary,
not far from where Kelpie had first looked down
upon the castle.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Ewen, “be away out of Campbell territory
as quickly as ever you can! Away around the tip of Loch
Fyne, and then east is best, but be canny. You’ll not be
safe with the MacFarlanes, either, but the Stewarts of
Balquidder are hostile to the Campbell, and the MacGregors
and MacNabs, and they are past Loch Lomond.
Best to skulk low during the day, for you’ll not get so far
this night—though I’m hoping you’ll not be found missing
until Uncle Archibald is returned and the cell door
opened.”</p>

<p>Kelpie nodded. The weight of horror was lifting (though
she would never quite forget it), and she began to feel
quite cocky again. Fine she was now, for who knew more
about skulking and wariness in the hills? And yet through
her cockiness crept an odd curiosity.</p>

<p>“Will <em>he</em> be finding out ’twas you who freed me?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” said Ewen, and there was laughter in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
lilt of his voice. “No one is thinking I know about the
secret tunnel, and they will probably believe you escaped
by witchcraft. Be careful, Sheena, the next time you’re
wanting to hex someone,” he added and vanished back
into the tunnel.</p>

<p>Kelpie stared down the blackness after him and shook
her head wonderingly. He was another daft one, to take
a risk for someone else, and with no profit to himself whatever!
But she was grateful, for all that. She owed much
to his daftness.</p>

<p>She left the cave, lifted her face to the infinite space
of the open sky, and breathed deeply of the free air. The
moonlit side of the hill was ghostlike, a pale glow without
depth. The dark side was a soft, deep purple-black. Patches
of glimmering mist rose from the loch, and there was a
line of it behind the western hills. Kelpie laughed aloud
and headed northeast.</p>

<p class="tb">Thick gray mist poured over the hills from the west,
covering the world with a layer of wetness. A curlew gave
its eerie call, the whaups shrilled, and presently it began
to rain. Kelpie shivered a little, even though the gray
wool dress was the warmest she had ever owned. She
had got soft, then, living in houses. She must steal a plaidie
somewhere—preferably one of plain color, or a black and
white shepherd’s tartan. Wearing the tartan of a clan
could get her into trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time it was really light, she had passed the tip
of Loch Fyne. She rested for a while, but it was cold sitting
still, she was getting more and more hungry, and as there
was little enough chance of being seen through the thickness
of the mist she went on again. Once out of Campbell
country she might risk stealing as well as begging, but she
must be careful about telling fortunes or selling charms,
for she would be getting near the Lowlands, where the
arm of the Kirk was long and strong and people were
narrow-minded about such activities. And Kelpie very
much wanted to avoid any more trouble of that sort.</p>

<p>She waded through the dripping tangle of heather and
bracken and wondered what to do next. She was free of
Mina and Bogle—unless they found her again. Did she
dare return to Glenfern, having left the way she had? No,
for they no longer trusted her, and Alex was now her
enemy. Moreover, if Mina ever found out, she would put
a curse on Wee Mairi. It seemed she must give up her hopes
of learning witchcraft from Mina, and any other witches
who still lived in Covenant territory would be very canny
and quiet indeed. She might try the Highlands, but there
was a problem too, for in order to get there without recrossing
Campbell territory, she must go far east and then
north and through another danger zone, where there had
been fighting and trouble since spring. And even in the
Highlands there was danger of meeting Mina and Bogle,
and further danger that Alex might have set all the Camerons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and MacDonalds against her, as he had threatened.</p>

<p><i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> Indeed and it was a braw mess she had got herself
into! She cursed the Lowlander, Mina, Bogle, Mac Cailein
Mor, the Kirk, and Alex, with fine impartial vigor and in
two languages. Then, for good measure, she added Antrim
(for forcing her hand too soon), the King (for his general
fecklessness), all religious bodies, God, the Devil, and
people in general.</p>

<p>When she had finished she felt no better, either mentally
or physically. She had now traveled some twenty miles
over thickly brushed and wooded hills, on an empty
stomach, after a shattering experience, and even Kelpie’s
wiry toughness had its limits. Had she reached friendly
territory yet? How was she to know without seeing a clan
tartan that would tell her? Well, surely she was for the
moment way ahead of any possible alarm out for her.
She must have food, and there was a shieling hut below.</p>

<p>She sat down in the drenched heather and absently regarded
a small twig of ling, already in bloom a month
ahead of the ordinary heather. The tiny lantern-shaped
blossoms were larger and pinker than heather too, not
quite as charming, perhaps, but still tiny perfect things.
Plants were nicer than people, if less exciting. She stared
at it while she thought up two stories; one to use on a
Campbell or a MacFarlane, the other for Stewart or
MacNab. Then she stood up, brushed the wet from her
skirts, and started slowly down the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>An old woman stepped out of the low hut to empty a
pail of water, and there was no mistaking the light and
dark reds crossed with green on her plaidie. It was MacNab.
Her husband, no doubt, would be out in the hills with the
sheep or cattle. Fine, that. Women living alone in the hills
were rather more likely to be sympathetic and motherly
toward a forlorn wee lass than men. (On the other hand,
women of the Kirk towns were like to be dourly suspicious
and hating.)</p>

<p>The old woman started to go back inside and then
caught a glimpse of Kelpie, who stumbled a bit because
she was hungry and tired—and because it was her general
policy.</p>

<p>“Whoever is it, then?” The Highland lilt of the Gaelic
was less marked here, near the Lowlands, and the voice
cracked slightly with age—and yet there was in it a note
like a bell.</p>

<p>“Och, forgive me, just.” Kelpie’s voice was faint, and
she swayed slightly. “I am weary and hungry, and could
you be sparing just a crust?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Seadh</i>, the little love!” Mrs. MacNab was all sympathy.
“Come away in, then, and I’ve a fine pot of oatmeal on
the fire. Whatever will you be doing all alone and in the
hills?” She looked at Kelpie with wise old eyes as they
entered the dark shieling, and frowned in puzzlement.
“From your dress you would be a lass from a Covenant
home, but your face is giving it the lie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Kelpie instantly revised her story in the brief time it
took to step through the low doorway under its bristling
roof of rye thatch. She stood meekly on the earthen floor
under the smoke-blackened rafters and noted at a glance
that these folk were better off than some, for there was a
real bedstead in the corner instead of a pile of heather and
bracken, and four three-legged creepie-stools.</p>

<p>“Eat now,” invited her hostess, handing her a big bowl
of oatmeal from the iron pot over the fire. “And there are
bannocks here, and milk. And then perhaps you will tell
me about yourself, little one, for I confess I’ve a fine curiosity,
and strangers are none so common here.”</p>

<p>Kelpie made use of the respite to ask some questions
and get her bearings, in between ravenous mouthfuls of
food. “Be ye Covenant here?” she ventured around half
a bannock.</p>

<p>“Och, and can you no see my tartan?” demanded Mrs.
MacNab. “We MacNabs are loyal to our own Stewart
King, foolish darling. Why, then, are you of the Kirk?”</p>

<p>Kelpie shook her head vigorously. “Not I! ’Tis a prisoner
of the Campbells I’ve been. They wanted me to be of the
Covenant and refused to tell me who my parents are, at
all. And so I have run away—”</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” interrupted Mrs. MacNab with wide eyes. This
was the most exciting thing that had happened in the
braes of Balquidder this many a year. She was ready to
believe anything of the hated Campbells. “Oh, my dear!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Is it that they were stealing you, then? Tell me all about
it, heart’s love, every bit!”</p>

<p>And so, replete and comfortable, warm and very nearly
dry, Kelpie spun a wonderful long tale of truth and fiction
mixed. The lonely old woman eagerly drank it in, with
exclamations of indignation and sympathy. When Callum
MacNab, looking like a twisted and weatherworn pine,
came in at dusk, he had to hear it all over again, and by
this time Kelpie had thought up a few more interesting
details. She fairly basked in their attention and tenderness,
while the old couple glowed with kindness and the rare
treat of company and news. And so, with one thing and
another, Kelpie spent the night and the next day with
them.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_12">12. Meeting at Pitlochry</h2>

<p>“’Tis sorry I am to see you away, wee dark love, but
you must be putting more distance between yourself
and the Campbells. And you must be searching for
your own true family. To think of it! And you say Mac
Cailein Mor was telling you himself that ’twas from a chief
he stole you?”</p>

<p>“And I but a bairn,” agreed Kelpie firmly. Having Callum
and Alsoon believe her tale so readily almost made
her believe it herself—and, after all, might not some of it
be true? She tucked the little bundle of oatmeal and scones
into her belt, and hugged the rough warmth of her new
plaidie about her shoulders, pleased that it was the neutral
black and white of the shepherd’s tartan and would not
associate her with any particular clan.</p>

<p>Luck was with her again, she reflected, that she had
found these kind and simple people, willing to give her
the food from their mouths and the clothes from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
backs—much simpler, if less exciting, than stealing. It
made her feel odd to be <em>given</em> things this way. Perhaps if
all folk were like these, or like Ian and his family, there
would be no need to steal. Warm with a novel sense of
gratitude, she was careful not to take anything from Callum
and Alsoon that they had not given her.</p>

<p>They stood just outside the low doorway in the brightness
of the summer evening. The rain had become mere
clouds glowing to the northwest, where the sun would
soon dip briefly below the hills. The old couple regarded
her anxiously, not at all happy to see her set off in the
white gloaming.</p>

<p>“Look you, now,” repeated Callum, “you must be going
south and east for a bit, through Drummond and Stewart
country, and then north through Murrays and Menzies,
and when you reach Pitlochry, just be finding the home
of my daughter Meg, at the tanning shop next the Tey
River, and tell them I sent you, and they will care for you
until you are away again.”</p>

<p>“Aye, then,” murmured Kelpie, anxious to be gone. She
had heard these directions at least twice before, and in
any case she knew the country far better than she dared
to let Callum know.</p>

<p>“Haste ye back,” they said, and this Highland phrase
was never used unless truly meant. No one had ever said
it to Kelpie before. She caught her breath, turned her head
away, and hurried off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Traveling, she found, was easier without Mina and
Bogle than with them, in one way. For folks had only to
take one look at those two to know the worst. But Kelpie,
as long as she kept her eyes lowered and her lip tucked
demurely in, looked quite innocent, so that, even on the
edge of the thrifty and Kirk-trained Lowlands, people
were usually willing to give her food—and when they
didn’t, Kelpie simply helped herself.</p>

<p>Now and then she picked up rumors about what was
going on in the Highlands, particularly concerning Argyll,
who was, it appeared, still away in the west, chasing an
elusive Antrim.</p>

<p>As nearly as Kelpie could make out from bits here and
there, Argyll had chased Antrim back to Ardnamurchen,
where the latter had left his ships. But the ships had been
spirited away by the English, just as Lorne had suggested,
and since then the two forces had been playing catch-me-if-you-can
all over the Highlands, with Antrim trying to
rouse the clans against Argyll, the clans either afraid or
quarreling among themselves, while Argyll tried to catch
Antrim’s small army before it should become a larger
army.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said an old man, chuckling, in a voice not meant
to be overheard. “Argyll will never be fighting a battle
against more than half his number if he can avoid it.”</p>

<p>“Dinna mock him!” whispered another. “Ye’ll no be
wanting yon wild foreign Hielanders crossing the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
wi’ their wicked screechin’ pipes and attacking us,
will ye?”</p>

<p>“Dinna fret, they’ll no come. ’Tis too busy they are wi’
their own heathen fighting; Papists, the lot o’ them.”</p>

<p>“They might, if Montrose could stir them up tae fight
for the King against the Covenant.”</p>

<p>“They would never do that. He’s a Graham from the
East Coast, and those savages in the West would never stir
a foot for any but their own chiefs. Anyway, they say
Montrose is vanished altogether, and no doubt dead.”</p>

<p>They both bent lowering gray brows when they saw the
shamelessly eavesdropping Kelpie. She scurried away hastily,
lest they think her a spy.</p>

<p>She wandered on, begging, stealing, and listening, until
she came at last to Pitlochry.</p>

<p>There seemed a braw lot of people in the narrow streets
of the town, and, surprisingly, many of them seemed to be
wearing Gordon or MacDonald tartans. Whatever were
those clans doing here? And those two young men striding
along the street toward her.... “<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” said Kelpie, and
they all stopped short.</p>

<p>They stared at one another with mixed feelings. “Why,
whatever will ye be doing here, at all?” demanded Kelpie
with astonishment.</p>

<p>Alex recovered his wits first. “Why,” he said with the
old mocking grin, “we were missing you and your bonnie
friends so badly that we had to come away to look for ye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sssss!” remarked Kelpie, concealing her pleasure at the
old bantering and reminding herself that Alex was a treacherous
enemy. Moreover, she was never again going to permit
herself the dangerous luxury of caring for anyone at
all. Having told herself this, she turned to look at Ian with
delight. A braw lad! Did he carry a grudge against her?
she wondered anxiously.</p>

<p>“And are you all right, Kelpie?” he asked kindly. “Mina
and Bogle are treating you well?”</p>

<p>“Sssss,” she said again. “They are wicked <i lang="gd">uruisgean</i>, and
I have left them this long time ago. I did not want to be
leaving Glenfern whatever,” she added hopefully.</p>

<p>Ian looked pleased, but Alex laughed. “Aye, it was a
good enough life you were leading there, after all. But you
seem to be doing well enough for yourself the now. Where
were you stealing the gey sober gown and plaidie?”</p>

<p>“I was not stealing them whatever!” Kelpie was outraged
more by his manner than by his words.</p>

<p>“But you would be saying the same thing even if you
had,” encouraged Alex with a straight face.</p>

<p>Kelpie’s lips began to curve upward as she remembered
the teasing at the loch-side at Glenfern. She tried to frown,
for it was not right to be teasing with Alex when they were
no longer friends. But she could not help it. “Of course,”
she agreed cheekily and grinned.</p>

<p>“Och, the wicked wee lass!” Alex chuckled. “She’ll never
change!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, now, but she has changed!” Ian objected. “She
could not laugh at herself when first she came to Glenfern.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure ’tis herself she’s laughing at?” gibed Alex.
“Or is it ourselves, just, for being ready to forgive her so
easily—and after she was breaking the ancient code of
hospitality.”</p>

<p>“It was not my fault!” protested Kelpie. “Mina was
threatening to put a curse on you all if I did not come with
them.”</p>

<p>“Och, how tender you are of our welfare!” said Alex
derisively. “And that, I suppose, is why you were so quick
to tell her all about how Ian and I met the King and
Montrose in Oxford?”</p>

<p>There was no use trying to explain, for he would never
believe her—not that she cared a groat what Alex MacDonald
thought, anyway. Perhaps she would be able to
tell Ian about it some day, with Alex not around. An idea
was growing in her mind. After glowering at Alex, she
turned to Ian and looked up at him meltingly through long
lashes. She had never before set out to beguile a lad, but
Janet had put the thought in her head, and she might as
well try now and see could she do it. Some deep instinct
awoke, so that she seemed to know just how to go about it.
“And what is it you are doing so far from Glenfern?” she
asked softly.</p>

<p>Was it her fancy that Ian’s smile seemed a wee bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
warmer than usual? “Why,” he said, “we are with Colkitto’s
army, up at Blair Atholl, and—”</p>

<p>Kelpie forgot about beguiling him. “Colkitto!” she
yelped. “You mean Antrim?”</p>

<p>“Aye, ’tis what we call him; Alistair MacDonald, Earl
of Antrim, who has—”</p>

<p>“Fine I know that!” interrupted Kelpie. “But where will
Mac Cailein Mor be, then? On your tail?” There was alarm
in her voice, and both lads regarded her curiously.</p>

<p>“Na, na,” Ian said soothingly. “He’s away back to his
own country, raising a larger army, no doubt, since some
five hundred Gordons have joined us. Are you afraid of
him, Kelpie? And what are you doing here, and where are
you living?”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked wistful. “I am all alone, and nowhere to
five.” She sighed and then smiled up at him brightly. “It
is in my mind to come along with you,” she announced.</p>

<p>Alex laughed. Unprincipled little thing though she was,
he did enjoy her shameless, incorrigible audacity! The
workings of her mind fascinated him, and even though he
could see through her so easily, he could never remain
angry for long.</p>

<p>Ian looked thoughtful. “Well, and why not? We’ve
nearly as many women and bairns as we have men, for
Colkitto brought the whole of his clan over with him to
take back their land from the Campbells. And Lachlan
brought his wife Maeve along to be cooking and nursing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and caring for us, for she does not trust Lachlan to do it
properly. You’d be far safer than wandering alone. What
about it, Alex?”</p>

<p>Alex shrugged and lifted a red eyebrow. “Ou, I’ve no
doubt at all that she can look after herself,” he observed
dryly. “But I’ve no objection; only, Ian <i lang="gd">avic</i>, let us not be
trusting her as far as tomorrow, for there is no loyalty in
her.”</p>

<p>The lazy mockery of his voice had a whiplash in it, and
Kelpie flinched, unexpectedly hurt by it. She lashed back,
remembering the scene in Loch nan Eilean.</p>

<p>“You!” she fumed. “You, to be talking of loyalty, who
would strike down a friend from behind!”</p>

<p>Alex gaped. It was the first time she had ever caught
him out of countenance, and it gave her great satisfaction.
Ian looked distressed. “Och, now!” he protested hastily.
“Let you both be saving your fighting for the Covenant
armies. Come away back to the camp, now, and we’ll talk
as we go.”</p>

<p>They started back, out of Pitlochry and over the narrow
road lined with tall blooming thistles. The heather, just
preparing to bloom, glowed rustily under the patchy sunlight.
Alex strode along frowning, still smarting and dumfounded
over the outrageous flank attack. What could she
have meant by it, the wee witch? She had seemed genuinely
indignant, too. For once she was not acting; Alex
had been matching wits with her long enough to be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of that. Then what under the great heavens could he have
done to draw such a denunciation, such withering scorn
from an unprincipled gypsy lass who would doubtless
betray her own grandmother for a bit of copper? It made
no sense whatever. And although Alex reminded himself
that the opinion of a wee witch could scarcely matter, he
found that it rankled. “<i lang="gd">Dhiaoul!</i>” he muttered under his
breath and knit his brows in annoyance, leaving most of
the conversation to Ian.</p>

<p>“And why is it you’re so concerned over Mac Cailein
Mor, Kelpie?” Ian asked. “Have you been studying more
politics since you left Glenfern?”</p>

<p>Kelpie hedged. “Is it likely I’d be wanting to run into
the head of the Covenant army, and him death on gypsies
and all who do not belong to the Kirk? No, now”—she
shifted the subject—“tell me what has been happening,
and why Colkitto has his army at Blair Atholl.”</p>

<p>“Well, so.” Ian thought for a minute, his sensitive profile
clear and grave against the mauve and russet and olive of
the August hills. Kelpie tilted her own face to look at him
as she kept easy pace while Alex walked, brooding silently,
behind.</p>

<p>“Did you know,” began Ian, “that Colkitto brought over
his whole clan to fight for the King against Argyll and the
Covenant, and perhaps take back some of the MacDonald
land from the Campbells?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fine, that!” murmured Kelpie, remembering that day
at Inverary. “And Argyll away after him all over the Highlands.”</p>

<p>Ian nodded. “And the English burned Antrim’s ships, so
that he must stay here, will he, nil he. So he has been trying
to get the other Highland clans to join him. He’s not
had much luck, for some of the clans fear the Campbells
too much, and some others have decided that they hate
the MacDonalds even more than the Covenant—for the
moment, at any rate. Lochiel doesn’t dare call out our
clan yet, with Ewen still in Argyll’s hands, and—more
important—with Argyll’s army so near to Lochaber. Can
you imagine what would be happening to our women and
children at Lochaber if Lochiel took the men away to fight
the Covenant?”</p>

<p>Kelpie could imagine, easily. Her blood ran cold at the
thought of Wee Mairi in danger, and she nodded soberly.</p>

<p>“Some of us Camerons have come along anyway, and so
have some five hundred Gordons who are wanting revenge
against Argyll,” continued Ian. “But most on this side of the
mountains think we Western Highlanders are a band of
wild savages, like the Red Indians of America. And even
Stewart of Atholl—although he hates Argyll and the Covenant—will
have nothing to do with the Irish MacDonalds.
So—” He grinned at Kelpie mischievously. “We have
just borrowed Atholl’s castle from him, and now we sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and wait.” He sobered again. “I do not know what we will
do next. There is a rumor that Graham of Montrose is still
alive, and perhaps he is our hope. But to tell the truth,
things do not look very good, and the Covenant armies
will not sit still forever.”</p>

<p>Kelpie’s lip lifted in sudden anger. “Och, ye will be
losing this war, just!” she predicted despairingly. “For
yourselves, and for the folk like me who want only to be
left alone. You cannot get together even to save your own
lives, but must always be quarreling clan against clan, and
so ye will lose!”</p>

<p>Ian looked depressed, but Alex came out of his black
reverie with a laugh. “Listen to her, just!” he taunted. “The
lone lass who lives for herself and no other will be giving
us a lesson on cooperation! But even though you don’t
practice what you preach,” he added somberly, “you’re
right.”</p>

<p>A puffy cloud blew over the sun, darkening the bright
hills, and the thistles waved in a sudden sharp breeze.</p>

<p class="tb">The small army was spread over the hill and moor near
Blair Atholl, looking somewhat dispirited. Some men were
hopefully cleaning their gear, polishing the huge two-handed
claymores and battle axes which struck such terror
into Lowland hearts. Others just sat, or wandered, or gambled,
or talked. Women were busy gossiping, sewing, cooking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
arguing; but one tall, gaunt woman brooded alone.
Children ran about playing tag or hanging about the men.
A ragged, motley crowd it was, but fierce-looking enough,
no doubt, to folk on this side of the mountains. Kelpie
frowned suddenly. The whole scene looked familiar.</p>

<p>“We’ve set up our wee camp spot over yon, just near
those rowan trees,” said Ian, pointing to a spot partway
up the hill. But before they were halfway there a flurry
of excitement near the edge of the moor turned into an
uproar. Men began shouting, running. A single shot was
fired, and then several more.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t be an attack!” Ian frowned, staring across
the moor, “but what is it?”</p>

<p>“’Tis he!” shouted Alex. “’Tis Graham of Montrose!
Look you there!”</p>

<p>“The King’s Lieutenant!” “He’s come!” “My Lord of
Montrose!” The words were being shouted back and forth,
and the sound swelled into a thunder of cheers. Kelpie
found herself running with the lads toward the center of
the excitement.</p>

<p>As nearly as she could see through the crowd, the Lord
of Montrose seemed to be a slight young man in groom’s
clothing, with brown hair and a bunch of oats stuck in his
bonnet. <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> She had seen him before! And now from the
wooded hill a red-bearded giant in the MacDonald tartan—Antrim—rushed
down to clasp the hand of the slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
young man, and Kelpie remembered. She had seen it in
the crystal, that first morning at Glenfern.</p>

<p>And so now they had come together, Antrim and Montrose,
totally different and yet fighting for the King’s cause.
What would be the outcome?</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_13">13. The Hexing of Alex</h2>

<p>The immediate effect of Montrose’s arrival was that of
a most powerful magic charm. It could not have been
more telling had he come with a full army at his back
instead of just one man, his cousin Patrick. The King’s
standard was raised then and there on the hillside and
saluted with a flourish of trumpets, and cheers, and triumphantly
skirling bagpipes. And some of the clans who
had been hovering about waiting to attack the Irish Highlander
Antrim now came to join the King’s Lieutenant,
Montrose—including Stewart of Atholl.</p>

<p>Kelpie decided to stay for a while. Things looked interesting.
She was safer here than wandering alone. Besides,
she liked Ian’s company, even if it meant putting up with
Alex. She even thought that she just might persuade Ian
to guard himself against his precious foster brother, though
she had not much hope of this, Ian being so stubbornly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
trustful. Besides, since she had “seen” the thing in the loch,
it would surely happen, and there was nothing she could
do to stop it.</p>

<p>For a while, staying with the army meant simply staying
right there where it was. Nothing much seemed to be
happening. Clans—or, more often, bits of them—drifted
in. Kelpie roamed where she liked, usually with the lads
and their watchful <i lang="gd">ghillie</i>, Lachlan, exchanging insults
with Alex and hostile silence with Lachlan and his wife
Maeve, who had no use for her whatever and made no
secret of it.</p>

<p>She also spent some of her time gazing speculatively
at the tall, gaunt woman whom she had noticed the first
day she arrived. The woman would stare for hours into
space, a black, brooding look on her face, her hands
twisting together as if she were wringing someone’s neck—or
perhaps casting a new kind of spell. A bulky Gordon
plaidie covered her broad shoulders, and, though she was
not old, there was the beginning of gray at her dark temples,
and there were strong, grim lines along her mouth.
Her eyes were deep-set and a little alarming, and Kelpie
wondered whether she might be a witch. She looked it.
Perhaps she had been tortured by witch-hunters and had
somehow escaped? Kelpie considered approaching her
about learning the Evil Eye, but the woman’s fierceness
made her hesitate. She might get a curse put on herself for
her boldness, and she could do fine without <em>that</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The coppery hills began to turn purple with the blooming
of the heather. It rained. No more was heard of Argyll,
but there were rumors that the enemy commander, Lord
Elcho, was in Perth with an army of seven thousand and
looking with considerable interest toward Blair Atholl.
“And we with only two thousand men,” commented Alex
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Ou, aye,” agreed Ian with a grin. “But just think of our
fine store of weapons!” Lachlan looked sour, and Kelpie
raised a derisive eyebrow.</p>

<p>“Artillery?” mused Alex. “None.”</p>

<p>“Cavalry—three old horses, one of them lame,” chanted
Ian.</p>

<p>“Guns—some old-fashioned matchlocks, and all the ammunition
we could be needing to shoot a third of them for
one round each.”</p>

<p>“And then,” finished Ian in triumph, “just in case we’re
needing them, there’s a few swords, claymores, and battleaxes—not
to mention the <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i>” he added, reaching
down to tap the wee dirk where it nestled in his stocking,
just on the outside of his right knee.</p>

<p>“And”—Alex chuckled with ironic optimism—“Montrose
has been saying that the enemy has plenty of
weapons, and those of us without can just help ourselves
once the fighting has started.”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked at them. There was, she felt, a definite
limit to the things a body should be joking about. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
so. And Lachlan, who felt personally responsible for the
safety of Ian and Alex, for once agreed with her.</p>

<p>And now came Maeve, whose loyalty was all toward
Mac ’ic Ian, heir to Glenfern (for Master Alex, although
a foster son, was not actually a Cameron at all). Her orange
hair gleamed even in the cloud-filtered sun, and she
addressed herself to Ian.</p>

<p>“Food will be ready,” she said and crossed herself as
she looked at Kelpie. As they all started toward the rowan
tree they called home, she added, half under her breath,
“Herself eats enough, whatever, but will never be doing
any cooking.”</p>

<p>“You were not liking my cooking,” observed Kelpie complacently.
It was no accident that the one meal she had
produced, at Alex’ insistence, had been perfectly awful.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé</i>, no!” Ian agreed, laughing. “You said she was trying
to poison us, Maeve. You’d not be wanting to try that
again, would you?”</p>

<p>“’Tis gey queer,” retorted Maeve, “for a gypsy not to
be able to cook over an open fire.”</p>

<p>Ian looked at Kelpie, his keen mind as usual fighting
with his desire to believe the best of people. Alex began to
laugh. “Och!” he exclaimed ruefully. “And I the one who
was never going to be fooled by her again!”</p>

<p>Kelpie saw an opening. “Gypsy taste will be different
from yours,” she announced blandly. “When I was first
stolen, it was a dreadful time I had getting used to gypsy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
food! It was nearly starving I was, for a while.” Her blue
ringed eyes widened with the picture of a poor wee bairn
pining away with hunger.</p>

<p>Lachlan snorted.</p>

<p>“Ou, the pity of it!” said Alex mournfully, his angular
face looking almost tender. “And you used to royal food,
and all. I’ve wondered, just, whether ’tis yourself was the
princess stolen from our King and Queen all those long
years ago when they visited the Highlands.”</p>

<p>For a minute Kelpie was fooled. Her eyes were a smoky
blue blaze as visions of royal grandeur hurtled through
her mind. Of course! Why not?</p>

<p>“For shame, Alex,” said Ian reproachfully. “She’s nearly
believing it.”</p>

<p>Kelpie jerked out of her dream and hissed venomously
at Alex, who chuckled impenitently and wondered how
she would try to get even this time.</p>

<p>The next day Kelpie went down to the burn, where she
had noticed that the soil had a sticky, claylike quality.
There she sat for some time, screened by broom and high
bracken, and slowly shaped a small clay figure—not that
it looked much like Alex, she being no artist. In fact, she
admitted, a body could barely tell that it was supposed to
be human at all. But perhaps the intent was the main
thing. If only she could get hold of a bit of his hair or a
fingernail—but Kelpie had had enough of hair-stealing for
a while, particularly red hair. Anyway, Alex was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
too canny. She had never yet managed to steal anything
from him without being caught. No, she would just have to
be trying her hex without it.</p>

<p>There were brambles conveniently near. Kelpie picked
a long thorn, regarded her clay figure thoughtfully, and
then plunged the thorn deep into the area where the
stomach might be expected to be.</p>

<p>Then she wrapped up the hex figure, went back to the
rowan tree, and began to watch Alex hopefully.</p>

<p>Two days passed, but if he had any pains in his stomach,
he concealed them very well. Kelpie added a second thorn
to the figure, this time in the head, and again waited. By
rights, his brains ought to start melting away, but she must
not be doing it right, for Alex’s brains remained as uncomfortably
keen as ever. He didn’t even get a headache.</p>

<p>Kelpie began looking wistfully at the tall, gaunt woman
again. If she <em>was</em> a witch, she could undoubtedly help.
And yet—Kelpie noticed that the men of the army did not
treat her at all as a witch. Far from shunning her, they
went out of their way to be kind, to bring her choice bits
of food, to talk to her. Once again Kelpie decided not to
risk trouble. She would manage her own hex, impotent as
it seemed to be.</p>

<p>In disgust, she took it out again, plunged thorns all
over it, rubbed it with nettles, burned it, and then watched
again. After five days Alex did twist his wrist slightly, but
somehow Kelpie failed to feel much satisfaction. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
quite sure that she had never put a thorn in the left wrist.
So she gave up trying to hex him. Either she didn’t have
the power at all, or else—which seemed quite possible—Alex
had a greater power.</p>

<p>Lord Graham of Montrose had a great power too. Kelpie
found herself more and more interested in him. The look
of him was not that of a strong leader at all. Slight, he was,
with gentle dark gray eyes and a quiet and courteous air
that hardly seemed to belong in an army at all, much less
at the head of one. Now, Antrim looked like a leader indeed,
massive red giant that he was, with a great roar of
a voice. Yet there was no doubt that Montrose was the
heart and soul of the army. Everyone, even Antrim, listened
to him with respect amounting almost to worship,
and everyone said that he had a genius for warfare.</p>

<p>Was it magic? Quite likely, Kelpie thought. She took to
watching and listening whenever he was among the men.
But she never saw him make any magic signs, and his
words were about such things as honor and loyalty and
why he was fighting for the King. Ian had said Montrose
wanted no power for himself, but only for right to be done,
but Ian was gullible. Skeptical, Kelpie kept her ears open.</p>

<p>“Loyalty is the great thing,” Montrose remarked one
day, sitting at ease in a misty drizzle, kilted Highlanders
all around him. They listened with eagerness and respect,
but Kelpie, at the edge of the group, narrowed her eyes
mistrustfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Loyalty to your clan and your King, to an ideal, to a
friend, to a thing you believe,” he went on. “This is integrity;
and it is loyalty also to yourself.” Kelpie frowned. It
was only loyalty to oneself that paid. She had found that
out. Montrose was like Ian, then, too generous and trusting.
They would both suffer for it, no doubt, unless they
learned to care only for their own welfare.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Montrose, “King Charles is a Stewart,
and so we have a double loyalty to him—as our King, and
as a Stewart and a Highlander. The English Parliament
and the Scottish Covenant wish to rule the King and all
of us as well. I think I need not tell you that.”</p>

<p>There was a growl from the group. “Aye, Mac Cailein
Mor would be King Campbell with the help of the Covenanters!”
“A plague on the lot of them!”</p>

<p>“And so,” urged Montrose, “we must put aside lesser
loyalties and quarrels amongst our own clans, and stand
together.”</p>

<p>“Aye!” shouted the men, but Kelpie privately thought
that Montrose’s magic would fail at this point. Who ever
knew a Highlander to give up his clan feuds for anything
at all—except a greater clan feud?</p>

<p>She did learn one thing about Montrose. He used different
words with different kinds of people—just as she
herself did, in a way. She was eavesdropping one evening
as he sat by his campfire with Antrim and Patrick Graham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of Inchbrakie, and his words to them were less simple and
certain than those to the untaught clansmen.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “I do not fight for what people call the
Divine Right of Kings. I don’t believe there is such a thing,
Alistair. A king must be subject to the laws of God, nature,
and the country that he rules. But as long as he stays
within those laws, then he should <em>be</em> the ruler.”</p>

<p>“And if he doesn’t?” It was Patrick Graham, called
“Black Pate.”</p>

<p>The youthful face looked troubled in the firelight. “It’s
true King Charles hasn’t always obeyed the rules,” murmured
Montrose. “That is why I supported the Covenant
at first. But then I saw the greater danger we courted. If
a group of subjects takes over the king’s power, they may
become a far worse tyrant than ever a king could be, and
that is what happened. You see yourselves how the Covenant
oppresses the people; and I think those who are
fighting for the Parliament in this war may find that
they’ve used their own blood and their own fortunes to
buy vultures and tigers to rule over them. To tell you the
truth, my friends, I don’t know the right way to handle a
king who abuses his power, but I do know that this is
the wrong way. Perhaps there should be some limit set
to the amount of power that one man or group can have.”</p>

<p>Kelpie chewed her lip thoughtfully. Och, now, and
there was a good idea. She could think of several such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
whose power should be limited to nothing at all. She
would begin with Argyll and the Covenant, and go on to
the Lowlander and Mina and Bogle. But how would one
set about arranging this?</p>

<p>In her preoccupation, Kelpie forgot that she was hiding
and carelessly shifted her position so that a twig cracked.
A small twig it was, and most folk would never have
noticed, but these men were well schooled in danger.
Three heads turned as one, and an instant later Antrim’s
huge hand was plucking her from her hiding place as he
would a puppy.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” He chortled, holding her up in the orange light
of the fire and looking her over with interest. “Here’s a
fine dangerous enemy in our midst.”</p>

<p>“Och, indeed and I am not!” protested Kelpie as well
as she could. She tucked in her lip and looked pathetically
at Montrose. “Do not be letting him hurt me, your Lordship!”
she begged in English. “’Tis only a poor, wee, harmless—”</p>

<p>“Let her down, Alistair,” suggested Montrose gently,
“and perhaps she can tell us what she was doing there.”</p>

<p>“Spying for Argyll, perhaps?” suggested Patrick narrowly,
looking at her gray dress.</p>

<p>Kelpie’s indignation was genuine. “That <i lang="gd">nathrach</i>!” She
sputtered earnestly and went on to curse him vigorously.
“He is a <i lang="gd">droch-inntinneach uruisg</i> and a red-haired devil
with a black heart in him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Montrose, who knew little Gaelic, looked interested.
“What was that?” he inquired, and Antrim chuckled.</p>

<p>“She called him a serpent and an evil-minded monster,”
he translated. “And I’m thinking she meant it, too! Well,
then, why <em>were</em> you skulking there, lass?”</p>

<p>Once again Kelpie found semi-truth to be the most
effective answer. “Och,” she whispered, ducking her head
shyly. “I was wanting to see himself, and to be hearing
him talk, for the singing tongue in his mouth.” From
beneath lowered lids she observed that their faces were
amused and tolerant.</p>

<p>“Well, and so you’ve heard him,” said Antrim, not unkindly.
“Away with you, then, and don’t be doing it again.
Next time you might just be getting a claymore instead
of a question.”</p>

<p>Kelpie left meekly enough, relieved to get off so easily.
But none of her questions was really answered. She had
wanted to learn the source of Montrose’s power, and
whether or no it was from magic, and if and how she
could learn it. For although it was just possible that Montrose
could destroy his archenemy, Argyll, which would
be a fine thing indeed, Kelpie felt that Mina and Bogle and
the Lowlander were another matter, and up to her. For
sooner or later she was almost sure to run into them again,
and when that day came she was going to need a great
deal of magic power indeed!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_14">14. The Battle of Tippermuir</h2>

<p>At last word went round that the army was to move,
but not, as Kelpie had expected, away from the danger
of Perth and Lord Elcho’s great army. Quite the contrary.
They were, it seemed, going to take Perth.</p>

<p>Recklessness and practical caution fought within Kelpie.
A fine, daft, gallant, and suicidal idea it seemed to her. If
she had any sense in the head of her, she would take her
leave now and head for safety. But she decided, instead,
to go along but to stay with the women and children
well behind the lines, once the fighting started, and then
take to the hills when the battle was lost.</p>

<p>The small, poorly equipped army gathered itself together
and started south to the sound of pipes playing
valiantly. They had got no farther than the hill of Buchanty
when they ran into one of the enemy forces which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
had been surrounding them all the time. A full five hundred
bowmen it must be, and Kelpie looked around hastily
for something to hide under.</p>

<p>But she had reckoned without Montrose. He and Antrim
rode to meet the two leaders of the bowmen, and they
talked. And, sometime during the talking, Montrose cast
his spell, for presently the two forces spread out over the
purple masses of blooming heather and ate together, the
leaders still talking over wine and food.</p>

<p>And then one of the enemy leaders sprang to his feet,
and Kelpie could hear his words clearly. “You’re wrong!”
he shouted. “’Tis not two thousand men ye have, but two
thousand and five hundred! For we’ll never be fighting
against Montrose!”</p>

<p>Kelpie shook her head wonderingly. Why on earth did
Montrose fight at all, if he could do this? Or did Argyll
and others have some kind of counter-magic? Kelpie began
to feel newly discouraged about her own prospects
for magical powers, with so much competition about.</p>

<p>The newly expanded army moved on again, undisturbed
by the news that, in addition to his seven thousand
infantry, Lord Elcho also had some eight hundred cavalry
and nine pieces of heavy artillery. The Highlanders, like
Kelpie, put their faith in the magic of Montrose. With him
to lead them, no force on earth could beat them.</p>

<p>They spent the night on the moor of Fowlis, and early
in the morning were away down the Small Glen, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to Tippermuir. There stood the walled town of Perth,
some three miles away. And between stood the Covenant
army, spread wide, waiting to catch Montrose’s impudent
small army between its fierce jaws.</p>

<p>Kelpie looked at it with awe, and some of her assurance
left her. Surely, now, Montrose was stretching his powers
too far! Lord Elcho would be wiping them out as easily
as Antrim might knock down herself. There they stood, six
deep, every man protected by corselet and an iron headpiece,
and the most of them armed with muskets, against
one-third the number of Highlanders, who wore only ragged
kilts and rawhide brogans and had claymores and
bows and arrows, or no weapons at all. It was a sad contrast.</p>

<p>The citizens of Perth seemed to regard the coming battle
as a fine new kind of Sabbath sport, for they had turned
out in great numbers to watch the fun. Kelpie shoved
through the palpitating crowd of women and children,
now well behind the army, until she reached a spot on
high ground which gave her both a good view and a
quick escape route for when she needed it. And she expected
to need it. She hoped that Ian might escape the
slaughter somehow, but she was going to be quite sure
that <em>she</em> did.</p>

<p class="tb">Ian, who had an even better view in his spot in the
front row of the battle line, was not feeling very optimistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
himself. He looked with resignation over the flaunting
blue banners of the Covenant ranks bearing the motto:
<em>For Christ’s Crown and Covenant</em>—and then back to the
one brave royal banner—three golden leopards on a red
background—floating above the Highland rabble. The
breeze rippled its folds and shivered across the purpled
moors. It seemed too fine a day for men to die.</p>

<p>Alex turned from chaffing his cousins among the small
band of Keppoch MacDonalds and looked at Ian. There
was a touch of pallor beneath the sunburn of his angular
face, but his eyes were bright.</p>

<p>“And are you frightened, Ian?” he asked with a crooked
grin.</p>

<p>“As ever was!” retorted Ian forthrightly, and Alex
chuckled.</p>

<p>“And I too,” he agreed. “My cousin Archie has just been
saying it’s only a fool does not fear danger—in which
case, I’m a wise man indeed!”</p>

<p>Ian looked around him. Most of the ordinary clansmen
seemed not much worried. There was an almost supernatural
faith in Montrose, that he would bring victory at
any odds. And Antrim—the magnificent Colkitto—strode
down the line with confidence in every inch of him. His
legs were pillars beneath the MacDonald kilt he wore, and
they were matched by the size of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I think <em>he</em> isn’t afraid,” observed Ian.</p>

<p>Alex nodded agreement. “Montrose is worried, though,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
he murmured. “You can see it behind his eyes. What is
happening now?” For one of Montrose’s officers was going
toward Lord Elcho, waving a white flag of truce.</p>

<p>“Here’s Ranald,” said Archie. “He’ll know. Ranald learns
everything.” If Archie was frightened, one would never
know it. His black eyes sparkled wickedly from under his
thick black hair, and he turned eagerly to make room for
another Keppoch cousin. “What is it Ranald, <i lang="gd">avic</i>?”</p>

<p>“An envoy of courtesy,” reported Ranald, shaking his
fair head wonderingly. “Montrose has sent to ask is it
against their principles to fight on the Sabbath, and would
they rather wait for tomorrow. Only Montrose would
think to make such a gesture!”</p>

<p>Archie, who seemed to have a low opinion of Covenant
principles, shook his head disapprovingly. Alex opened
his mouth for a jesting remark, and forgot to close it again.
For, incredibly, outrageously, the envoy was being taken
prisoner! He was seized, bound, hustled off through the
Covenant ranks.</p>

<p>Incredulous anger rippled through the Highland army.
Ian stood aghast. “He couldn’t!” he whispered. “He
<em>couldn’t</em> violate a flag of truce!” And for once even the
more cynical Alex shared Ian’s feelings.</p>

<p>Oddly, Kelpie’s face came to Alex at that moment. Her
narrow, slant-eyed, impudent face would be wondering
what was so awful about violating a white flag. Was it any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
worse than killing a man in battle? And the envoy wasn’t
even dead—yet, anyway. To his disgust, Alex found himself,
in his own mind, trying to explain it to her. “<i lang="gd">Dhiaoul!</i>”
he muttered and turned his attention to the matters at
hand.</p>

<p>It was quite possible that Lord Elcho had done himself
an ill service, for a flame of Celtic rage had engulfed the
Highland army. Alex found that he had shifted forward
an inch or two without knowing it, and the rest of the
army with him. Those without weapons had picked up
stones. For a moment it seemed that they would all break
into a wild charge, but Montrose achieved the minor miracle
of holding them back. “Wait!” said his outflung arm.
“Wait!” boomed Antrim. “Be patient a wee while, men of
my heart, and we soon will be giving them cold steel
for it.”</p>

<p>And they waited, only inching forward a toe at a time,
as the Covenant army moved closer, until not a hundred
paces separated them. A long wait it seemed, long enough
for all the army to hear Lord Elcho’s answer to the message
of the unfortunate envoy. “The Lord’s Day,” he had
said, “is fit for the Lord’s work of exterminating the barbarous
Irish and Highlanders.”</p>

<p>“When we charge,” muttered Archie, who had been in
battles before, “keep just one thing in mind. Choose your
enemy and kill him, and then a second man if you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well so,” agreed Alex mildly. “And what will I
do with my third man?” He was pleased that his voice
had just the nonchalance he wanted for it.</p>

<p>Ian’s was equally cool. “Just be leaving him to me,” he
said. “I’ll have had my three by then.”</p>

<p>Another inch forward, and the Covenanters closer yet,
and still no signal to charge. And now came the Covenant
battle cry for the day. “Jesus and no quarter!” they yelled,
and Ian shuddered at the blasphemy.</p>

<p>And then suddenly came a shrill wild skirl from the
gaunt woman at the back of the battle. A voice lifted and
pealed savagely. “Wolves of the North! Let the fangs bite!”</p>

<p>And the signal was given, and as they rushed forward
Ian’s voice answered with his own clan battle cry. “Sons
of the dogs, come hither, come hither, and ye shall have
flesh!”</p>

<p>“God and St. Andrew!” answered the Keppoch MacDonalds,
and the air was thick with the wailing menace
of pipes and clan cries, until the pipers abandoned their
pipes for the claymores, and the slogans became scattered
and mixed with mere yells.</p>

<p>Neither Alex nor Ian remembered the rest clearly—only
a wall of armed men ahead, and then the smashing,
tearing impact of battle. There was Archie’s fighting
laughter, and the blazing red beard of Antrim ... someone
yelling “A Gordon, a Gordon!” the whole of the fight.
And then there was no wall of armored men, but only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
fleeing backs, and the charge went on and on—until they
were at the gates of Perth.</p>

<p class="tb">When Kelpie reached Perth, some time later (and a
messy three miles it was too, littered with Covenant casualties),
she fully expected to find it being thoroughly
sacked and looted, and to be in time to pick up a few wee
things herself. It was just for this that she had managed to
get slightly ahead of the rest of the women and children.</p>

<p>But there was unexpected quiet and order. Kelpie
paused inside the gate, frowning. A few citizens peered
fearfully from windows, waiting for the worst, but the
worst did not seem to be happening. Instead, Highlanders
stood about, glaring at the frightened heads and at a
shouting preacher on the near corner, and looking disgruntled.</p>

<p>“He shall rain snares upon the sinners,” screamed the
preacher, “and fire and brimstone and storms of wind shall
be the portion of their cup!”</p>

<p>Kelpie joined a group of ragged Highlanders who were
standing there listening. “<em>Now</em> will he remember their
iniquity and visit their sins!” the preacher was suggesting
hopefully. “I will consume them by the sword, and by the
famine, and by the pestilence! I will pour their wickedness
upon them!”</p>

<p>“Is it ourselves he means?” asked Kelpie of the nearest
Highlander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded, looking disgusted. “And we not even allowed
to feed his words back to him,” he growled. “And,”
he added regretfully, “I am thinking that the fine coat of
him would be fitting me, whatever.”</p>

<p>“But why? Why not be silencing him and taking it?”
demanded Kelpie. He shrugged, looking aggressive. Montrose,
it seemed, had ordered no sacking, no looting, no
harm to the citizens.</p>

<p>Several Highlanders turned from the preacher, who was
now informing them that they were to be cast forth from
the land, and chimed in. An unheard-of thing, that! And
they half-starved and in rags, and counting on food, clothing,
and a fine wee bit of loot from these overfed, psalm-singing
heathen hypocrites! And what was Montrose
about, then, to be depriving them of their just reward?
And yet, not a man suggested disobeying.</p>

<p>The preacher, a gaunt, long-faced man in a fine black
coat, was working himself up into a fine passion of Covenanter
Christianity. “They shall die grievous deaths,”
he announced. “They shall not be lamented, neither shall
they be buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of
the earth.”</p>

<p>“Is it his own friends he’s speaking of?” came Alex’s
mocking voice. “’Tis a fine burial service you’re preaching,
my friend, but shouldn’t you be helping to dig the graves
first?”</p>

<p>The preacher stopped, glared, and began to launch forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
with more Bible verses. But the Highlanders had got the
idea.</p>

<p>“Now then,” one of them called, chortling. “’Twould be
no harm to the bonnie man if we just see to it that he
helps bury his friends, now, would it? Come away out,
now, and be useful!” And in a moment the preacher was
being propelled firmly out of the gate, protesting loudly
that yon muckle redshanks were gang to murther him.
Alex and Ian, Archie and Ranald were left, grinning after
them.</p>

<p>Kelpie spared them no more than a glance and then
returned to her grievance. No looting! And she had been
wanting a nice silver belt and perhaps a silken purse.</p>

<p>Disgustingly, Ian and Alex agreed with Montrose. “’Tis
a barbaric practice, sacking cities,” said Ian with quiet
intensity. “Why should soldiers war on civilians, especially
women and bairns? If there were more leaders with the
principles of Montrose, war would be less evil than it is.”</p>

<p>“There’s no use one army stopping, and the others going
on doing it,” argued Kelpie.</p>

<p>“Someone must be stopping first,” Alex pointed out.
Odd how he kept trying to explain principles to this little
witch, who could no more understand them than could
his cousin Cecily’s wee and wicked yellow kitten. “If Montrose
shows mercy, perhaps the Covenanters will do the
same.”</p>

<p>Kelpie sneered audibly, and Archie made a rude noise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Alex shrugged. “To be more practical,” he pointed out,
“perhaps Montrose is hoping that these towns near his
own home may be turned to our side if we treat them
well.”</p>

<p>“I think he would do so anyway,” insisted Ian, “’Tis a
point of integrity, Kelpie.”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked blank, and Alex laughed. “Do not be
trying to explain integrity to <em>her</em>, Ian!” he pleaded. “Begin
first on a creature with more capacity—like Cecily’s kitten,
for example—and then Dubh, perhaps, and after that you
might be working up to a kelpie.”</p>

<p>At the mention of Cecily, Ian saw in his mind a heart-shaped,
mischievous face in a halo of tawny hair. And
then he put it away from him, for Alex had said fifty times
that he was going to marry his cousin one day; and if
his foster brother wanted Cecily, then she was not for
Ian to think of. So he thought instead of Kelpie, who was
tossing her black head scornfully.</p>

<p>“Well, whatever integrity is,” she announced, “this is
daft. For,” she predicted with gloomy relish, “all the towns
around will be thinking they may do as they please, with
no fear of punishment. Just wait you now, they’ll be shouting
more loudly and burning more witches than ever
before.”</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Alex nodded. It was Ian who was about to
argue. But at this moment Lachlan and Maeve arrived,
shouting that at last they had found Mac ’ic Ian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
would he be coming away this minute to have his sore
wound tended.</p>

<p>Ian laughed, faintly embarrassed, and began to protest.
And Kelpie, with a pang of concern, noticed for the first
time that his plaidie was wrapped oddly about his left arm
and that a stain of red was creeping along the sleeve
beneath it.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” she cried. “It may be only a wee bit cut as you
say, Ian, but yon orange-top”—she glared at Maeve—“has
not the sense to be tending it for you, and it will
surely mortify if you let her. I,” she announced firmly, “will
bind it myself, with bread mold and cobwebs on the cut,
and a wee charm or two over it, and ’twill heal overnight,
for I know about such matters.”</p>

<p>Maeve promptly screamed that the wicked little witch
would poison Mac ’ic Ian only over her dead body. Kelpie
retorted that it was a fine idea, that last. Ranald said that
he had known mold and cobwebs to work very well.
Archie’s black eyes sparkled with amusement, and it fell
upon Alex to arbitrate.</p>

<p>Firmly, with the masterful air that Kelpie usually resented
hotly, he declared in favor of her bread mold but
against her charms. He pacified Maeve by allowing her
to supervise and to put the sign of the cross upon Ian’s
arm. And because both Maeve and Kelpie were genuinely
concerned over Ian’s welfare a truce of sorts was declared—for
the moment.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_15">15. Witch Hunt</h2>

<p>An uneasy peace brooded over the whole of Perth the
next day. Not only the citizens but also their Gaelic
conquerors tended to feel slightly abused, and they spent
the morning glooming at one another. By noon the high
Celtic spirits had risen again in the conquerors, and a
spirit of mischief took over. They released prisoners from
stocks and jails (most of them guilty of such crimes as
failing to attend kirk), and some of the Irish MacDonalds
began preaching back at the dour, hell-spouting Calvinist
preachers.</p>

<p>But this palled too, and presently a group of young and
adventurous Highlanders decided just to go out and have
a wee look round the neighboring countryside. Archie and
Ranald came hunting Alex and Ian, who were delighted.
Lachlan firmly attached himself to the party, with strict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
orders from Maeve not to be letting Mac ’ic Ian do anything
to start his cut bleeding afresh.</p>

<p>At this point Kelpie announced that she would just go
too. Ranald looked at her dubiously, but Archie laughed.
“And why ever not?” he demanded. “The women do full
share of work, what with cooking and nursing, and should
have a bit of fun when they can. Will you come too,
Maeve?”</p>

<p>Maeve hesitated, glared at Kelpie, and declined. And
the party, some dozen or fifteen altogether, set off.</p>

<p>“Is Kelpie your true name?” demanded Archie as they
started west across the sweep of moor. He grinned at her
engagingly. “It wouldn’t be every day a body could have
a kelpie as mascot. Tell me,” he asked, “have I seen you
turn a soft eye upon Ian? Could you not be giving him a
wee love potion?”</p>

<p>Kelpie smiled enigmatically and declined to answer. But
she turned the idea over in her mind.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, this second of September. The
birches were beginning to yellow and the bracken to turn
rusty underneath. Rowan trees flaunted clumps of brilliant
red-orange berries in the sun; and only now and again
did a cloud shadow glide silently over the rosy-heathered
swelling ground, patching it with somber purple. Kelpie
tied her plaidie around her waist, for she would not be
needing it until the chill of evening.</p>

<p>They walked on, with the long, tireless Highland stride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
chattering and laughing with the upsurge of spirits that
was a normal reaction from the fear and triumph of yesterday.</p>

<p>“And did you get your dozen men, Alex?” inquired the
fair-haired Ranald. “I saw you once cutting down an armored
musketeer twice your size, and glad I was to be
fighting with and not against you.”</p>

<p>Alex’s red brows slanted upward. “<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” he said. “I was
so frighted I just held out my sword, and it seems the
enemy was obliging enough to run into it. ’Twas Ian was
the braw fighter, and none better in Scotland. It was he
saved me more than once.”</p>

<p>“Only so that you could be saving me, Alex <i lang="gd">avic</i>,” retorted
Ian, “and Lachlan saving the both of us,” he added.
“Besides, it was I was so scared I could only think to run
away.”</p>

<p>“And since you were headed for Perth, already, the only
thing to do was just cut your way through the face of the
enemy,” finished Archie with bland seriousness.</p>

<p>Ian nodded gravely. “That was the way of it. I was too
frightened to think of turning around.”</p>

<p>And so they went on, with the same old bantering
Kelpie had heard so often at Glenfern, and each of them
claiming to have been more frightened than any of the
rest. Kelpie listened with an odd feeling of contentment.
This brotherhood, this easy straight-faced teasing which
was an unspoken love between friends, was a warm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
joyous thing to hear—for all that it was dangerous to
have it. There was wistfulness in her heart as she walked
silently among the cheerful group, and a shadow on her
face.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a river and a small gray town
on the near side. “I doubt they’ll love us there,” predicted
a tall lad in Duncan kilt, “but perhaps their good Lowland
sense of business will make them willing to sell us a pint
or two of ale—or even good <i lang="gd">uisghebaugh</i>, if there is such
a thing outside of the Highlands.”</p>

<p>It was a popular suggestion, and the long Highland
strides became even longer, so that Kelpie—though she
denied it—had to stretch her own to keep up. As they
drew near the cluster of stone houses with the somber
square kirk in the center, she frowned a little. A dour,
gloomy place it was! Not that it looked different, really,
from other towns, but there was a bad feel to it. None of
the others seemed to notice, but Kelpie’s bones were wary.</p>

<p>There seemed to be very few people about. Perhaps
most of them had seen the Highlanders coming and gone
inside. The few folk they did meet cast looks of hate at
the kilted barbarians—which the barbarians, secure in the
safety of numbers and reputation, found rather amusing.</p>

<p>An innkeeper sourly sold them ale, with black looks
thrown in for good measure. “Och, wouldn’t he like to
poison it, just!” said Alex in Gaelic as Kelpie refused the
ale Ian offered her. It might not actually be poisoned, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
it could have an evil spell on it, all the same. She said so.</p>

<p>“If your spells haven’t worked, I doubt anyone’s could!”
Alex taunted her. “For you’ve tried hard enough, haven’t
you?”</p>

<p>Kelpie glowered from under her thick lashes. Had he
seen her, then, all that while at Blair Atholl? Or was it
just his evil way of always knowing what she was thinking?
She had begun to feel a trifle more friendly since
learning that he had saved Ian yesterday instead of cutting
him down. But once again Alex was taking the offensive.</p>

<p>Alex had known what she was about at Blair Atholl, and
it had amused him, in a way—once he was sure her spells
were impotent. But just now, for some reason, all her
hatred for him was rankling, and he was in the mood to
goad her a bit for her irritating ways—although he was
not at all sure why she got under his skin so easily. So he
deliberately treated her to his most satirical grin. “And
didn’t your hex work at all, poor lass?” he inquired sympathetically.</p>

<p>Kelpie started to hiss at him, but Ian was looking at her
oddly. He would not take it kindly that she had tried to
hex his foster brother, even though it was himself she was
trying to protect. And she wanted to keep Ian’s good will.</p>

<p>Her lip drooped. “Always and always you will be thinking
evil of me, Alex MacDonald!” she lamented. “You will
be trying to make everyone hate me, and never giving me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the chance at all to be better, no matter how I might try.”</p>

<p>The other lads were listening to all this with great interest,
and they now regarded Alex with severity, and
Kelpie with sympathy. But it was Ian’s sympathy she
wanted—and got.</p>

<p>“’Tis true enough, Alex,” he said accusingly. “You’ve
ever thought the worst of the poor lass, and her only sin
is in being what she was taught to be. How could she
ever change with you condemning her in advance?”</p>

<p>A rare blaze of rage swept over Alex. “<i lang="gd">Dhiaoul!</i> ’Tis a
fool you are, Ian!” And suddenly he was quarreling—it
was incredible—with his foster brother, dearer than kin,
and over a young rogue of a gypsy lass not worth a hair
on Ian’s head! And yet the quarrel went on and on.</p>

<p>Kelpie had never seen them angry at each other before,
and she was frightened. It was the town had done it! The
town was filled with hate and malice and had put a spell
on them all! And she, who should be pleased at seeing
Ian turn from Alex, found that she couldn’t enjoy it. She
couldn’t even bear to listen. She slipped out of the tavern
with their angry words drifting after her.</p>

<p>The streets were no longer empty. A crowd was streaming
out of the four-square meeting house and along toward
the town square, and it was the sort of crowd she knew
all too well. Their faces held a savage and bloodthirsty
fanaticism, and this was not a mob looking for a victim,
but one which had found one. It was someone, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
who had committed the sin of breaking the Sabbath, or
dancing, or perhaps chancing to glance at a neighbor’s
cow before it fell ill. Och, it was a witch trial they had
been having! No knowing was it a real witch or not, nor
would it matter; for to be accused was to be condemned.</p>

<p>“Burn them!” the crowd growled as it surged past the
tavern. Kelpie should have ducked back inside, but her
curiosity was too great. And despite her vow to be hard-hearted
there was a flicker in her of pity. The victims were
coming now, being roughly hustled along toward the
square. The crowd swept Kelpie along, not noticing one
more gray gown among so many others.</p>

<p>Kelpie squeezed through a gap between a stout man
and a bony woman, and as it closed behind her she found
herself almost pushed against the victims, her eyes staring
straight into theirs—and their eyes were as filled with
hatred as those of the crowd.</p>

<p>Mina and Bogle!</p>

<p>Panic gripped her heart. Frantically she tried to back
up, to melt back into the crowd. But there was no gap
now, only a wall of townsmen at her back. And it was
too late. Mina’s shrill screech cut the other sounds.</p>

<p>“There she is! The kelpie who led us into witchcraft!
In the gray dress! There! Look at the ringed eyes of her!”</p>

<p>“She’ll be putting the Evil Eye on ye all” croaked Bogle
venomously.</p>

<p>Sick fear and revulsion were in Kelpie as her quick eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
swept around—vainly—for an avenue of escape. They
were not accusing her to save themselves, which would
have been logical, but in sheer malice. That she might
have done the same didn’t occur to her, for there was no
time for thinking. The crowd was responding with a new
roar, seeking more blood, turning to find its new victim.</p>

<p>Kelpie looked instinctively for a scapegoat, another gray
dress to point out—but again, too late. Hands grabbed
her. She wrenched free with a twist, only to be grasped
by more hands, caught beyond hope of escape.</p>

<p>“Alex!” screamed Kelpie. “Ian! Help!” And she lifted
her voice in the Cameron war rant, hoping that the familiar
words might reach Ian. “<i lang="gd">Chlanna non can, thigibh
a so</i>—” A blow on the head cut it short, and she thought
with bitterness that it could not matter. How could they
hear her so far away, and over the crowd, and when they
were themselves quarreling in the tavern, and herself
being carried farther away every minute?</p>

<p>“Ye’ll not be taking a witch’s word!” she cried out. “I
am of the Kirk, and have been servant to Argyll himself!”</p>

<p>One or two of the nearest people hesitated doubtfully,
for Argyll was a name to conjure with. But Mina dashed
Kelpie’s faint chance. “Aye!” she shrieked. “To be getting
a bit of his hair for a hex! Look at her eyes, just!”</p>

<p>She was doomed, then. “Sons of the dogs!” she yelled
once more, with despair in voice and heart. And then she
was being shoved along with Mina and Bogle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Chlanna non can, thigibh a so’s gheibh sibh feoil!</i>” It
was Ian’s voice. A wedge began to cut itself into the
crowd from behind, a bright blade gleaming, and Ian’s
wild face at the back of the sword.</p>

<p>And then another voice, that of Alex. “<em>Ian!</em>” it roared,
and another wedge appeared behind the first. And now
figures in MacDonald and Duncan bonnets cut a swathe,
more swords gleamed, voices roared happily with the
joy of battle.</p>

<p>But Alex was coming after Ian, and a black rage on
his face, and his voice bellowing Ian’s name. He was angry
still, then, and the more so because Ian was trying to save
her! Kelpie’s feet were set against the cobblestones of the
street, her body twisted to see behind. And now the hold
on her was loosening as the witch-burners began to take
alarm. But oh, would Ian be in time? Would Alex stop
him?</p>

<p>Ian had nearly reached her. The crowd, mostly unarmed,
swirled and shoved in disorganized fury. They
turned from their victims now, and two or three dirks
were flashed. The MacDonalds were gleefully wreaking
havoc somewhere behind, but Alex had caught up with
Ian now, and his face was fearful to look on. Ian’s back
was to Alex, his attention on dealing with those dirks still
separating him from Kelpie. Kelpie could not see his
hands, for the shoulders and heads in the way, but his
face was grim, intent. “Hold on, Kelpie!” he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Ian!</em>” roared Alex again, and his sword rose—rose and
then fell with a furious slash. And Ian was down, and his
dark head had vanished in the crowd.</p>

<p>It was just as she had seen it in the loch! For an instant
Kelpie felt nothing at all but a terrible cold emptiness,
and then grief was in her very bones, and a small cry of
anguish on her lips. She made a move toward the swarming,
fighting spot where Ian had vanished. There was one
brief glimpse of Alex, raging like one gone mad, and then
the MacDonalds were there, making a havoc that sent
townspeople screaming for safety. And somewhere, being
trampled beneath, was the body of Ian, and perhaps she
could reach him and help....</p>

<p>And then she hesitated. Alex would be wanting to kill
her too! And now was her chance to be away and safe
from him. And after all, what good could she be to Ian?
For either he was dead and past help, or, if not, there
were the MacDonalds to care for him, and Maeve back at
Perth.</p>

<p>Kelpie hesitated a moment longer, then she reverted to
old habits and saved herself. She slipped like a hunted
wildcat through the crowd, which now had other things
on its mind than stopping her. She was out of it, around
a corner, through the narrow streets in a swift streak of
gray. The clamor grew muffled and scattered. She tore
across the stone bridge and the moor and along a glen
and over a hill. She ran until she could no longer breathe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and then crawled into a thick patch of broom and lay
gasping and sobbing.</p>

<p>She must not think! She could not bear to think. Alex
had really done it, then! The thing inside her had never
really believed he would, and that was the thing now
keening in black anguish that he could have done it.</p>

<p>And Ian! Was he dead, then? Dead trying to save herself,
who had then fled without a backward look?</p>

<p>But it was only sense to have saved herself! It was
what Ian had been trying to do, to save <em>her</em>, and wouldn’t
he have wished it? Why should it be the weight of a stone
on her? Ian would have wished it, she told herself. And
then she rolled over on her face and was violently sick.</p>

<p class="tb">How long had she been walking? And to where? It was
just away from the town she had been going, and she was
now far away, for she had spent more than one night
in the heather. And yet she could not get away from the
beating blackness in her mind.</p>

<p>Kelpie sank down in the drenched heather and discovered
with vague surprise that rain was pouring steadily
from a dreary sky. She looked wearily around and saw
nothing but hills and heath closed in mist. She was wet as
a water horse, and when had she last eaten?</p>

<p>What was she to do now? And where was she going?
She didn’t care much. It would be nice just to lie down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and not be waking at all at all. But some inner vitality
would never let her do that. She sighed. She must be finding
food, then, and learning where she was. For all she
knew, she might be back in Campbell country—and that
thought roused her just a little.</p>

<p>She dragged herself to her feet and tramped on again.
The glen ended in a long loch, so large that both ends
were out of sight around the curves of the hills. Kelpie sat
down again and thought, slowly, because she could not
seem to think very well. There were not so many lochs of
this size. She did not think she could have got so far as
Loch Rannoch, and this seemed too long for Loch Earn
and not wide enough for Loch Lomond. It must be that
it was Loch Tay, and if this were so, then she might well
be in Campbell country.</p>

<p>If only the sun would come out! If only there were
some place that she could go and rest and hide away from
the world and her thoughts....</p>

<p>And then she remembered the braes of Balquidder and
two kind and lonely old folk who had said, “Haste ye
back.”</p>

<p>At this point Kelpie’s instinct and gypsy training took
over. Without stopping to wonder was she right or no,
she turned to the left and trudged along the southern
bank of the loch. She found berries and roots to eat. She
lay down in the wet heather and slept, her plaidie around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
her, when she could go no farther. And then she awoke
and went on. To the end of the loch she went, and down a
glen, and around a mountain.</p>

<p>And late on a drizzly afternoon old Alsoon MacNab
heard a faint scratch at her door and opened it to find
her own plaidie back—wrapped round a morsel of wretched
humanity that for once was not shamming in the least.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_16">16. Morag Mhor</h2>

<p>It was pleasant to be cared for, pleasant and strange.
Kelpie lay for several days on the pile of springy
heather which served for her bed. At first she just slept
and awoke to eat and sleep again. But then she began
lying awake, her eyes on the smoky fire, or on the mortarless
stone walls that leaned a little inward against the
black rafters and thatched roof. Alsoon was always busy,
cooking or sweeping the earthen floor with a besom broom
or weaving or knitting, one eye always on her patient.</p>

<p>And why should they take her in and care for her so,
when they had nothing to gain by it? Glenfern had done
the same thing—no, best not to think of Glenfern, for that
was too painful. She must learn to wall off those memories
from her feelings, so that they would become like a witch-spot
on the body, a spot that could feel no pain even
though a pin was stuck in to the head. Kelpie had no
witch-spots, though Mina did. But then, Kelpie was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
witch, and what was more, she never would be, however
hard she might try!</p>

<p>The knowledge crept upon her stealthily, while she was
still too weak and drained to resist it. She had no power at
all. None of her spells had ever worked. And Mina had lied
about teaching her the Evil Eye. It came to her with bitter
clarity that the Evil Eye was a thing one must be born
with; it could never be learned. All Kelpie had was the
Second Sight, and many Highlanders had that.</p>

<p>She received the knowledge with a strange kind of indifference.
Later, when she wasn’t so tired, she would no
doubt feel a savage sense of loss. But she could not think
about it now—not yet.</p>

<p>Alsoon was bringing her some broth now and crooning
to her wee dark love to drink it and sleep. Callum must
have tramped far over the hills to find a deer to make it,
and they knew very well that she could never pay for it
at all, and they would be hurt even if she offered payment.
Highland hospitality was a warm, strong thing with rules
to it. It made a grace between host and guest and a bond
not to harm each other. This was why Alex had been so
angry at the way she left Glenfern, and Eithne so hurt,
and—and Ian—</p>

<p>She wrenched her mind from the thought of Ian, drank
her broth, and drifted back to sleep.</p>

<p>When she was on her feet again, Kelpie was strangely
content just to stay where she was. It seemed to her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
her life had been violently wrenched apart, and she hardly
knew how to begin putting it back together again. She
needed time to think. Kelpie had always found the world
full and interesting, however cruel. She played a game.
She avoided the cruelty when she could, and bore it if
she must, and fought back when she had the chance. She
adapted herself to each new situation that came along,
and had quite enjoyed—on the whole—the glimpses of
various new worlds that the last few months had offered.</p>

<p>But now she seemed to be cast out of every world she
knew, for she could never go back to Glenfern, or to Mina
and Bogle (even if she would), or to Campbell country.
Worse, she did not even know what she wanted, now that
the power of witchcraft was denied her. The old gypsy
life no longer seemed attractive. New ideas had been
planted in her mind, and she had found herself groping
restlessly for something she could not name.</p>

<p>To keep her mind and hands busy, she began to help
Alsoon and Callum with the various chores, and took an
unexpected pleasure in them. For once, walls seemed not
a trap but a warm, safe shelter from the early frost and
biting wind outside, and from the world in general.</p>

<p>And so the autumn passed, and it was the dark of the
year, with only a few brief hours of daylight and long gray
dusks. In that remote glen they heard little of the outside
world. It wasn’t until she had been there for two months
that a neighbor from over the hill came that way in search<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of stray cattle and stopped in to pass on the news that
his brother had heard from someone’s cousin who had
been away in to a town.</p>

<p>Montrose had taken his army north to Aberdeen, and
this time he had let his men sack the city. “It was because
they had shot a wee drummer boy,” explained the neighbor.
“The lad was just along with the envoy, asking them
would they like to send their women and bairns to safety.
And Graham was so angry at it that he took the town and
turned his army loose on it, but they say he was sorry
after.”</p>

<p>And then, it seemed, the old game of tag had started
again, with Argyll panting after Montrose all the way
from Bog o’ Gight to Badenoch, Tumnel to Strathbogie,
devastating lands as he went, and slaughtering people if
he even suspected them of royalist sympathies.</p>

<p>When Kelpie awoke the next morning, she saw the
white light of the first snow coming through the cracks
in the shutters, and her first, unbidden thought was: did
Ian lie somewhere beneath that blanket? Had Alex been
punished for killing him? Where was Montrose now, and
what was happening in Scotland? It was the beginning of
a new restlessness and a growing desire to learn whether
Ian was dead, and perhaps even to take vengeance herself
on Alex, if no one else had done it already. Even without
magic powers, she reflected with narrowed eyes, she
could still use her wee <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The dark, smoky shieling became too cramped for such
thoughts, and, in spite of the cold, Kelpie took to making
long walks over the braes and around the foot of Ben
More. Alsoon looked at her wisely. If she guessed that
confusing thoughts were disturbing the young waif, she
said nothing but merely finished whatever task Kelpie
might have left undone when the restlessness was upon
her.</p>

<p>“Och, and you’ll be away again one day,” predicted old
Callum mildly one crisp afternoon when Kelpie paused at
the sheep pen where he was working. “’Tis the wanderlust
you have in your feet—but are you not also wanting somewhere
to call home?”</p>

<p>Kelpie had never thought of the matter. She did so now.
What <em>was</em> a home? For Ian it had been Glenfern, where
his heart stayed wherever the rest of him might be. But
for Kelpie, Glenfern was not just a place; it was a feeling
and it was people. It was Wee Mairi’s bonnie face and
confiding smile; and the twins crowding close, bright-eyed,
to demand more stories; and Eithne’s quick sympathy;
and laughter beside the loch. It was teasing and
love and trust among them all, and her own heart given
recklessly against her better judgement.</p>

<p>No, home was not a place but a feeling—a deceitful
feeling, she remembered bitterly. She had endangered
Wee Mairi by her very affection, and Ian had trusted too
much.... And Kelpie thought again that if Glenfern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
had not settled the score with Alex, she herself might do it
one day. She thought of Mina and Bogle too, and hoped
fiercely that they had not escaped.</p>

<p>There was more heavy snow the next week, and now
this was nearly the longest time she had ever spent in one
place—except for Glenfern, and Glenfern had been much
more lively. She longed more and more for excitement, for
adventure, aye, even for danger, for these were the spice
of life. And so she stiffened with anticipation on the morning
that wee Angus MacNab came racing over the hill
toward the shieling hut. Important news was in his every
movement.</p>

<p>“Och, Callum, and have you seen it?” he demanded in
a shrill shout. “Montrose himself it is, and his army, just
yon over the braes on the edge of Campbell land. It is
said they will be going to harry Mac Cailein Mor in his
own castle!”</p>

<p>Kelpie had been standing over near the sheep pen, very
still, watching the small lad come. A too large kilt flapped
about his knobbly knees, and himself and his long shadow
and his twisting track were all dark against the white of
the snow. To her left was the black of the shieling hut,
smoke rising vaguely against the pearl-blue of the sky, and
Callum standing by the door. Everything seemed to stop
in time for just an instant, while something inside Kelpie
awoke, stretched, looked around, and made a decision.</p>

<p>She didn’t ask herself any questions then, but turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in her tracks and walked back to the hut, where Callum
and Alsoon were greeting the lad and asking for more
details.</p>

<p>“And where are they?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Angus waved a skinny arm toward the north. “Yon, near
Loch Tay. The clan is called out and will be joining there.
I wish I could be going!”</p>

<p>Sudden reasonless elation filled Kelpie. She wrapped
her plaidie more firmly about her shoulders and looked at
Callum and Alsoon. “I’m away,” she announced.</p>

<p>“Och, no, heart’s darling!” protested Alsoon. “Not into
Campbell lands, and in midwinter! Bide with us a wee
while longer, until spring.”</p>

<p>“I’m away,” repeated Kelpie, a little sharply, as she
realized that once again she was in danger of giving her
heart. “And what harm from cold or Campbells when the
army and all the women and bairns are along? I cannot
bide longer, for my feet have the urge in them.” And she
tossed her dark head like a young Highland pony, so that
the thick braids—well tended by Alsoon—leaped over her
shoulders and beat against her waist, as if impatient.</p>

<p>Alsoon sighed. “Well, then, and you must go if you must.
But come away in first, my light, and I’ll be giving you
food to take along. Dried venison there is, and fresh bannocks,
and oatcakes. And here are the new skin brogans
that Callum has finished for you.”</p>

<p>“Haste ye back, white love,” she added at last as Kelpie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
took the food and put on the shoes and stood looking at
her.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Kelpie, and her heart was torn. The MacNabs
gave and asked no return but to be able to give
more. “You’ve been kind, and I not deserving it,” she
murmured, and then clenched her fists and walked quickly
out of the low doorway, lest she be caught up in folly
again.</p>

<p>Halfway up the hill she paused, stared back at the long,
low shieling hut, and then waved at the two old people
standing there. Tears stung her eyelids for a moment, and
impulsively she crooked her forefinger, calling down a
blessing upon them.</p>

<p>Five minutes later she had shaken off her sadness. She
lifted her head and breathed the air of new adventure.
The hills had been calling this long while, calling through
the spell of black depression that was on her. But the spell
was broken now, and she was answering the call.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill she was seized by fresh exuberance.
Curving her arms upward like a stag’s antlers, she broke
into the light, wild leaps of a dance that the Highland
men did around the campfire or at friendly gatherings,
and then laughed aloud at her own impertinence—she, a
lass, to be doing a man’s dance, and doing it well too.
The dance took on a distinctly mocking and impudent
quality.</p>

<p>From the top of the next hill she looked down on Montrose’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
army, which had made camp by the loch. From
the mouth of the glen, the MacNabs were arriving, great-kilts
swinging about their bare, strong knees, and the top
halves of the kilts wrapped round massive shoulders.
Kelpie surveyed the scene for a moment before going
down, counting tartans. MacDonalds were still most
plentiful, with Gordons, MacPhersons, Stewarts—but she
saw no Cameron tartans.</p>

<p>She also saw no children, and only a small scattering of
women. Where were they all, then? Frowning a little, she
went down, over the snowy hillside, to the camp.</p>

<p>“Whist, lass, and what is it you’re wanting?” It was a
bearded Irish MacDonald. “The time for sweethearts’
farewells is past, and we off to raid and harry the Campbells
in their lair.” The beard split in a grin of vengeful
glee.</p>

<p>“It is I that am coming with you,” announced Kelpie
cheekily. “Where are all the women and bairns?”</p>

<p>He stared. “Back at Blair Castle, the most of them, safe
in Stewart country. It is only a few of the strongest, and
they with no children, that we have brought. ’Tis no adventure
for you, lassie. Be away back home.”</p>

<p>“I am strong, and with no bairns,” argued Kelpie. “And
I’m frightened to travel alone.” She looked helpless and
pleading. “I have no home, and I’d like well to raid the
Campbells. Can I not be coming?”</p>

<p>He grinned sympathetically. “Och, well—we’ve a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
bloody enough work to do, and might even use an extra
nurse once or twice. Go find Morag Mhor, then, who is
head of the women.”</p>

<p>Kelpie recognized Morag Mhor as soon as she saw her—the
tall, gaunt woman she had noticed at Blair Atholl,
who well deserved the title of “great” Morag. Ragged
woolen skirts were kilted up over a bright red petticoat,
showing ankles as sturdy as a man’s. The worn Gordon
plaidie had fallen back from her head, and her face was
more alive than it had been at Blair Atholl, but as fierce
as ever. When Kelpie found her, she was berating a red-faced
MacGregor at least two inches shorter than she,
who clearly had no fight left in him.</p>

<p>“And don’t be crossing my path again until I feel forgiving,
or I’ll box the other ear!” she finished briskly and
then turned to look at Kelpie. “Gypsy!” she said, crossing
brawny arms on her breast.</p>

<p>“Indeed and no!” protested Kelpie with great promptness.
“Only a poor lost lass, and away from home—”</p>

<p>Morag Mhor laughed loudly. “Gypsy!” she repeated,
pointing a long forefinger.</p>

<p>Kelpie regarded her warily and trimmed her tale. “The
gypsies were stealing me when I was a bairn,” she conceded,
not expecting to be believed.</p>

<p>“Aye, then,” agreed Morag Mhor surprisingly. “Because
of the ringed eyes of you, I think. You’ll have the Second
Sight. Are you a witch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you?” countered Kelpie, remembering with a pang
that she herself was not and never could be.</p>

<p>Morag shrugged wide shoulders. “I have a healing
power. But I’m not belonging to any coven of daft folk
who hold Black Mass and dance their silly feet off at midnights.
My power is in what I’m doing, not what I’m
saying.” Her lined face drew down fiercely. “I’ll be helping
to put the curse of deeds on the Campbells this week.
They passed my happy wee home in Gordon country and
left behind a blackened stone—and I arriving back from
over the hill to find the thatch still smoldering, and my
man dead, and my son beside him, and the lad not yet ten!
I have thirsted for Campbell blood ever since, and I shall
drink deep.”</p>

<p>She stopped, staring into the white distance with eyes
that were of burning stone. Kelpie reflected that she would
not like to have this woman for an enemy. Best to go
canny.</p>

<p>“I was prisoner of Mac Cailein Mor,” she volunteered.
“He would have burned me, but I escaped.”</p>

<p>“Och, then, and you’re another who hates him!” Morag’s
eyes returned from unpleasant places. “Stay along with
me, then, gypsy lass. We’ll see revenge together, and no
man nor devil will harm you whilst I am near.” And Kelpie

<h2 id="Chapter_17">17. The Road to Inverary</h2>

<p>They had slept on the border of Campbell country,
after feeding on Campbell cattle collected by some
twenty or thirty Highlanders. Their tightly woven woolen
plaids had helped to keep out the cold, and so had the
fires scattered along the glen. But Kelpie was glad enough
of the red wool hose that Alsoon had knitted for her, and
of the warm bulk of Morag beside her.</p>

<p>Now they were heading up Strath Fuile, and the warm-hearted
comradeship of the Highlanders became a savage
expectation, for here at last was the great enemy ahead.
Montrose might talk all he liked of getting to the border
to aid the King in England—but a score or two must be
settled first. Montrose had had to compromise; otherwise
too many of his army would have just slipped away home,
taking with them as many stolen cattle as possible.</p>

<p>Now an advance party had gone ahead of the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
army to find cattle before the owners could be warned
and drive them off to hide in the hills. And Morag Mhor,
with a dark and unpleasant grin, had attached herself and
Kelpie to them. The men, knowing of her murdered husband
and child, let her join them, with a grim jest or two
about the fate of any Campbells unlucky enough to run
into her.</p>

<p>They rounded a curve in the river, and there before
them was a long, low shieling hut with two children playing
out in front and a handful of cattle scattered up the
hill behind. Morag saw the hut first and was off toward it
with a flash of red petticoat. Kelpie wished suddenly that
she had stayed with the rest of the women, but she hurtled
after Morag simply because it didn’t occur to her to do
anything else. Now the men had seen it too, and a menacing
yell rose from thirty throats as some of them raced
around after the cattle, and the rest—mostly Irish MacDonalds—followed
Morag and Kelpie toward the hut.</p>

<p>Even as she was running, the thing inside Kelpie felt
sick at what was to come. Campbells they were, certainly,
but what fault had the bairns committed? Montrose would
be angry, surely, with his scruples about making war on
the innocent. Now the children had seen them and were
running toward the house, screaming with terror. An
ashen-faced woman gathered them to her and then paused
in the doorway, uncertain whether to run inside or away
into the hills. Kelpie could almost taste the fear in her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Kelpie’s foot hit something soft and yielding. She
tripped and flew head first into a patch of wet snow. There
was a wail of pain and—the cry of a small child.</p>

<p>Kelpie raised her head from the snow in time to see
Morag stop, whirl, and race back toward Kelpie and the
child. Was she going to begin her revenge by killing the
bairn?</p>

<p>“Is it hurt that you are?” roared Morag, but she was
not speaking to Kelpie. She picked up the crying child
and stood, her gaunt face twisted with the conflict of
feelings going on in her. Then she turned to Kelpie, with
the Irish MacDonalds only a few yards from them. “Come
on!” she ordered and raced with the child toward the hut
and the cowering woman.</p>

<p>Bewildered, Kelpie scrambled up and followed, just
barely ahead of the men. Morag thrust the baby into its
mother’s arms, whirled, and drew her <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i>.</p>

<p>“You’ll not be touching them, whatever!” she bellowed
at the astonished giant who led the pack. “Back, or I’ll
skewer you, Rab MacDonald! Am I not a woman and
mother myself? A plague on men and war! Back, I say!”</p>

<p>She was terrifying; her avenging fury turned to defense
of her prey. It was altogether too much for the Highlanders.
They stood and stared, a full dozen of them in a
semicircle before her.</p>

<p>“Fine brave soldiers ye are!” jeered Morag. “Are ye no
afraid to be attacking such dangerous foes? Here’s the wee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
bairn, now. Will one of you not challenge him to fair
combat?”</p>

<p>They shuffled their feet, quite taken aback. The madness
that Morag herself had kindled in them trickled out,
to be replaced by the Highland sense of the ridiculous.
One of them chuckled, and then several others began to
roar with laughter. “And is this your own vengeance,
Morag Mhor?” they hooted. “I will be remembering this
the next time you are clouting me on the ear and send for
a bairn to protect me,” added the giant called Rab.</p>

<p>Morag Mhor seemed not to care about the teasing. She
stood guard over the grateful little family while the cattle
were caught and while the rest of the army arrived on
the scene. And, with the backing of Montrose, she defied
those who wanted to burn the house.</p>

<p>“I can do no more for ye,” she told the Campbell woman
when the army and its captured cattle had started on
once again. “You have your bairns and your home—although
your Campbell army left me neither, nor husband.
I intended to do the same to you, but I could not, for I
saw myself in you, and it came to me that a woman’s place
is to give life, not to take it. It comes to me, too, that men
are a senseless lot with all their useless killing, and perhaps
we mothers should be raising our sons to different ideas.”</p>

<p>And then she turned abruptly and headed in long strides
back to the Highland army, not waiting for the stammered
words of thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Kelpie trailed along at her heels, saying nothing but
thinking a good deal.</p>

<p>And so it went, along to Tyndrum and up Glenorchy.
Morag Mhor vehemently defended every woman and
child they found, against the threats and wild arguments
of the Highland soldiers. It didn’t take Kelpie long to
discover that all this was a great act put on by the Highlanders
for Morag’s benefit, and it was a surprise to her
that a woman as shrewd as Morag didn’t know it too. But
she never guessed.</p>

<p>“I know you for the braw liar you are,” remarked Kelpie
saucily to Rab one morning over their beef-and-oatmeal
breakfast. “You will be teasing her every time, and you as
softhearted as herself.”</p>

<p>“As ever was,” agreed Rab, rolling a dark eye at her.
“But do not be telling Morag, whatever, for it is not just
teasing. With the grief of her, she is needing something to
fight, but she is happier to be fighting us to save bairns
than the other way around.”</p>

<p>Although the campaign through Campbell territory was
less bloodthirsty than Kelpie had expected, still it was not
pretty. Men of fighting age found little mercy, few cattle
escaped the voracious appetite of the army, and more than
a few barns and thatch roofs went up in smoke behind it.</p>

<p>Blazing fires and roasted meat were good at night, after
long and cold marches. Since there were so few women to
do the cooking, the men helped too, with good will and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
bantering. Kelpie poked at a haunch of beef one chill but
clear evening, thinking to herself that they were going a
long way round to Argyll at Inverary, in a huge triangle
to north and west. Surely by now Argyll would have received
word of this invasion! Kelpie wondered what he
would be doing about it. The obvious thing would be to
come away after them, and she looked apprehensively
toward the purple-black hills that surrounded the orange
firelight.</p>

<p>“Is there food for a starving—Why, ’tis the water
witch!” Kelpie turned to face Archie MacDonald, whose
black eyes were sparkling with curiosity. They stared at
each other.</p>

<p>“And where did you vanish to that day?” he demanded.
“A braw lot of trouble and grief you caused! If you’ve the
power to vanish into thin air, you might have been doing
it before Ian Cameron was cut down trying to save you.”</p>

<p>Kelpie winced. “Was he killed entirely?” she asked,
her heart pounding for fear of the answer.</p>

<p>“Na, na, not entirely. But a nasty wound it was. Still,
he survived it, although he had to go back to Glenfern,
and no more fighting for the time.” Kelpie saw again in
her mind the savage downward sweep of Alex’s broadsword
and had to push aside the tumult of feelings that it
brought. But—Ian was not dead! Alex had not killed him!</p>

<p>“And Alex MacDonald?” she demanded balefully.</p>

<p>“He’s—away,” said Archie, and it was clear that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
going to say no more. But then, he was Alex’s cousin and
not likely to want to speak of it. At least Kelpie knew now
that Alex had not been hanged, and she thought again that
she might be the one to avenge Ian some day. For she
doubted that, even now, Ian himself would raise a hand
against Alex. She looked right through Archie, and her
slanted blue eyes held no very pleasant expression.</p>

<p>The meat was done now and being divided. Archie
pulled his <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> from his stocking, vanished briefly
into the crowd of hungry men, and emerged with a smoking
hunk for Kelpie in one hand and one for himself in
the other. She bit into the meat hungrily and then looked
up to find the deep black eyes still fixed on her, and a
question in them.</p>

<p>“That day,” he began, with an uncertain note in his
voice, “were you sending a call in the mind to Alex before
you gave the Cameron rant with your voice?”</p>

<p>Kelpie looked as blank as she felt. “I don’t understand
you whatever!” she said warily.</p>

<p>“Why,” he began, and frowned a little, “there we were
in the tavern, with Alex and Ian in a fury at each other,
and none of us even hearing the sounds outside. It was a
braw quarrel, with Ian gone white with the anger in him,
and Alex the color of a rowan berry. And then Alex was
stopping in mid-word, with an intent, listening look on the
face of him, and looking round. And it was because of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
silence that an instant later we were hearing the Cameron
rant, and Ian shouting ‘’Tis Kelpie in trouble!’”</p>

<p>Kelpie shook her head blankly. “And what then?” was
all she said.</p>

<p>Archie shrugged. “Why, then, Ian forgot the quarrel and
was away out the door, and Alex after him with drawn
sword, and the rest of us collected our wits and followed,
not knowing if Alex’s black fury was still for Ian, or for
the witch-hunters. His face was a fearful thing to see, and
I’m hoping I never meet the like in battle, for ’twould be
the end of me. But you know the rest better than I. How
was it, Kelpie, that Alex heard you even through the quarrel,
and before the rest of us?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Kelpie absently, her mind on another
question altogether. For the thing she had suspected
was clear. It was herself had helped bring about the scene
in the loch, and hatred of her had caused Alex to strike
down his foster brother. It was the only possible explanation,
and there was a sore hurt in the thought of it. How
could Alex have hated her that much, who had never
seemed to hate her at all, but only scorn her? Her short
upper lip curled. Och, he would pay for it, just! Even
though Kelpie could no longer hope for witchcraft to help
her, he would pay for it.</p>

<p>Archie looked at her uneasily. There was a look about
her not quite canny, and it was occurring to him that folk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
called after water witches, who could communicate without
the voice, might not be a braw choice for companionship,
so he brought her another hunk of meat—to avoid
offending her—and melted hastily into the crowd of soldiers.</p>

<p class="tb">The army passed the very spot near Loch Awe where
Kelpie had first seen Janet Campbell that June day six
months ago. And then they were heading at last toward
Inverary, through the steep wilds of Glen Aray where she
and Janet had gone. And what had been happening to
Janet all this time? she wondered. Not that she really
cared, she tried to tell herself, except that Janet was a
harmless soul and not deserving to be harmed by either
Mac Cailein Mor or his enemies.</p>

<p>There was no detour to the top of the hill this time.
Straight down the glen the army came, pipes shrieking
in ominous triumph. It was a braw sound indeed, a wild
song that set the blood running with joyful madness—or
the blood of Montrose’s army, at any rate. Kelpie wondered
briefly how it sounded to the ears in Inverary. Along
the river they marched, half running now, and erupted
into the valley, the town of Inverary seeming to cower
ahead on its point of land, and the castle—so familiar to
Kelpie—to the left.</p>

<p>Morag Mhor was with the men heading for the village,
loudly daring them to lay a finger on woman or child, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
voice rising as they insisted, grinning, that this time every
wee babe would be slaughtered, just. For once, this game
had no interest for Kelpie, and she headed straight for the
castle. If Mac Cailein Mor was captured, she wanted to
be there to gloat.</p>

<p>Everywhere there was clear evidence of surprise and
panic. The town and castle, unaware of the approaching
invasion, had been celebrating the Christmas season—in
their sober Puritan way, of course, with longer and more
frequent sermons. Kelpie’s lip curled with scorn for a
chief so feckless as not to know what was happening in his
own country—or else so sure of his invulnerability that he
took no precautions. Och, she could hardly wait to see him
taken prisoner! Her small white teeth fairly glittered in
her smile.</p>

<p>She had just reached the castle wall when a shout of
dismay and fury broke out. Kelpie rushed to a high knoll
where she could see. Men were pointing to the small
bay. A fishing boat was hastily heading out into the
loch.</p>

<p>“’Tis himself is running away!” And Kelpie hardly
needed a second glance to confirm it. Her keen eyes
picked out two red heads, the short bulk of Lady Argyll,
the patch of Cameron tartan that was Ewen.</p>

<p>“Ssss!” said Kelpie in savage regret.</p>

<p>The pipes lifted a wild wail of derision. “Oh, the great
Argyll!” someone yelled. “Brave General Campbell! What,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
will you be away off, Mac Cailein Mor, and us just come
to visit?”</p>

<p>Montrose wasted no time fuming over what couldn’t be
helped, although he must have been bitterly disappointed.
The capture of Argyll this day might have changed history—although
he had not the Second Sight to tell him how
much. Even Kelpie did not know, for the crystal had not
yet showed her the scene to come later, when Montrose
himself calmly mounted the scaffold.</p>

<p>His face was calm now as he gave orders to set about
taking the castle abandoned by its owner. It wasn’t as
difficult as it might have been. One couldn’t expect inspired
defense from the men who had been left behind
while their leader fled. And once Montrose’s men were in
full possession, Kelpie entered the castle through those
massive gates she had passed through before—but this
time with an arrogant sway to her slim body.</p>

<p>She wasted no time with the fine white bread and wine
that had been discovered, nor even with the miserable
figure of Mrs. MacKellar huddled on a chair in the hall.
She knew where she was going, and she wanted to be
the first one there.</p>

<p>Argyll’s apartments were deserted. She walked boldly
through the massive oaken doors, on into the inner chamber.
There was a fine large cairngorm brooch on the table,
mounted in silver, bigger than her fist. Fine, that! She
looked around. What else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>A thought struck her. The next chamber must be that of
Lady Argyll. In she went, and in a moment was kneeling
beside a chest of fine gowns. A pity there were none of
bright colors. Kelpie had always wanted a gown of flame-red
velvet, but of course such a thing would never be
found in a Covenant household. Still, there was one of
moss-green, and the softest, finest wool she had ever seen,
and not so <em>very</em> much too big, provided she belted it
tightly about the waist. And she laughed with joy. Here
was the fine silver belt she had always wanted.</p>

<p>Next she pulled out a lovely cloak the color of juniper—and
she must have it, although it was lined with Campbell
tartan—and a silken purse, a linen kerchief, and several
baubles. She tried on a pair of square-toed leather shoes
with silver buckles, but they hurt her feet sorely, so she
kicked them off and went back into Argyll’s room for a
silver snuff box she had seen there.</p>

<p>And as she stood, green gown bunched about her waist
under untidy thick braids (uncombed since leaving Alsoon),
the cairngorm in one hand and the snuff box in
the other, the outer door opened.</p>

<p>For an instant memory played tricks on her and she
thought that it was Mac Cailein Mor finding her there
with the hairs in her hand, and blind panic was on her.
Then it cleared as a voice spoke.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” boomed Antrim. “And whom have we here?”</p>

<p>“’Tis the eavesdropping lass from last summer,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
answered Montrose, standing still, taking in every detail.</p>

<p>Kelpie looked back at him fearlessly. He was amused,
she could tell. And besides, did not his scruples prevent
him from harming women or children, even enemy ones,
and she no enemy?</p>

<p>“I see you’ve wasted no time,” he observed mildly.
“How is it you’re here ahead even of your army commander?”</p>

<p>“I was knowing the way and wanting to be first,” explained
Kelpie artlessly. She waved her loot at him with
great pride in her cleverness.</p>

<p>He looked at it, and at her. The corners of his mouth
moved slightly. “That would be Argyll’s cairngorm, I suppose?”</p>

<p>She nodded, regarding it happily. Then something occurred
to her, and she glanced up at him dubiously from
under her thick lashes. Perhaps it might be wise to sacrifice
material gain—if necessary—for policy.</p>

<p>“Were you wanting it yourself?” she asked reluctantly.
“I will give it to you, if you like. There’s another nearly
as good in yon box,” she added, “and this a wee bit heavy
for a lass to be wearing.”</p>

<p>Montrose laughed. “No, I don’t want Argyll’s brooch,”
he assured her, to her relief. Then he looked at her seriously.
“I don’t suppose it’s ever occurred to you,” he suggested,
“that stealing could be a bad thing?”</p>

<p>“Och, aye!” exclaimed Kelpie earnestly, “You must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
very canny at it, my Lord, and lucky, too. For ’tis a bad
thing indeed and indeed to be caught! But Mac Cailein
Mor’s away in his wee boat, and no danger now.”</p>

<p>This time it was Antrim who boomed with laughter, and
Kelpie looked at him resentfully. Clearly he had had no
experience at getting caught, or he would never be laughing
at such a serious matter.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean quite that, although I’m sure it must be
true,” explained Montrose gently, and the corners of his
mouth were jiggling again. “I mean, did you never think
that it might be wrong to steal, whether you were caught
at it or no?”</p>

<p>“Och, no!” said Kelpie, wide-eyed. “But then, perhaps
’tis different for you,” she added kindly. “Being a chief and
lord and all, you will be able to get things without stealing
them, and I doubt you’re ever hungry, whatever.”</p>

<p>Montrose sighed. “Aye,” he agreed, seeming sad for
some reason. “’Tis different for me. You’d best run along
now, though.” And he turned to look after her as she left
the room.</p>

<p>Kelpie went back to the other wing, picked up an item
or two from Mrs. MacKellar’s room, and then stood still
for a minute, frowning at nothing at all. Why did people
persist in making her think about new and uncomfortable
ideas? A few months ago she would have been genuinely
puzzled by the notion that it might be wrong to steal, even
though a body was not caught at it. But now, even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
she had pretended not to know what Montrose meant, the
idea wasn’t really as startling as it would once have been.
It was the sort of thing the folks at Glenfern might have
said, or Ewen Cameron, or even Alsoon and Callum. It
undoubtedly had to do with the integrity thing Alex and
Ian talked of, and all of them wanting her to apply it to
herself. Why should she? Mina and Bogle had taught her
that anything was right if one got away with it—but then,
Mina and Bogle were evil, and perhaps everything they
said was wrong.</p>

<p>Kelpie sighed. On the other hand, Alex talked about
those ideas, and he was evil too. So what was a lass to
think, at all?</p>

<p>She wandered down into the main hall, which was still
a chaos of triumphant men. But she was so engrossed in
her problem of right and wrong that she quite forgot to
taunt the dejected and weeping Mrs. MacKellar. In any
case, it no longer seemed necessary. After all, the housekeeper
had been loyal to her chief, and it the only safe
thing to do—but would it not be safer now for her to side
with the royalist victors?</p>

<p>Kelpie frowned at the red-eyed and unlovely figure of
Mrs. MacKellar, for in it there was something undefeated
and almost gallant. No, Mrs. MacKellar would never
change sides, but would stay loyal to Mac Cailein Mor,
even though he was not worthy of it. Why? Did she fear
that he would come back? Or was this something like not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
stealing, that a body did even against his own interest?
Was that what integrity was? But what good was it? As
far as Kelpie could see, it was more likely to be a nuisance
than an asset.</p>

<p>She wandered over to one of the deep-set windows and
stared out, unseeing, her whole attention focused on her
thoughts. The folk at Glenfern, like Mrs. MacKellar, would
remain loyal for always to a person or ideal. This was part
of the thing about them which she had sensed from the
first—the daftness, the difference. True they would be,
whether or not it was profitable or safe, aye, though it
cost them their lives—all but Alex. And it was this, perhaps,
that had shocked her so. For Alex, surely, would
never change sides but would be true to an ideal—and
how was it, then, that he could betray a friend?</p>

<p>She leaned her forehead against one of the thick diamond-shaped
panes, dimming it even more with her
breath, and remembered that Montrose had talked of such
things back at Blair Atholl. But neither he nor anyone
else had ever explained to Kelpie why this way of acting
was desirable. Was it possible that there was some strange
kind of happiness in it? Did they have things inside which
would make them uncomfortable if they acted otherwise?</p>

<p>Kelpie stopped trying to understand, for she found
that there was an argument going on within her. The thing
inside her was saying that this was a fine and proud way
to be, but her common sense told her that it was not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
practical, and had she not vowed to think of herself first,
last, and always? And surely if it was a choice between her
own safety and any other thing (and she forced the
thought of Wee Mairi from her mind), surely it would be
only sensible to look out for herself, as ever was!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_18">18. The Black Sail</h2>

<p>Kelpie awoke from a dream in which she was trudging
along beside a loch against blinding rain. She blinked
a little as she remembered that she was back at Inverlochy
Castle—the same place she and Mina and Bogle had
spent the first night after leaving Glenfern. She shivered a
little, partly at the memory of Mina and Bogle, and partly
from cold. Hugging the stolen cloak and her old plaidie
about her, she hurried down the tower stairs and out to
the central court, where Morag Mhor and the other women
were preparing breakfast.</p>

<p>“Slugabed!” Morag greeted her, and Kelpie grinned
cheekily, knowing all about Morag’s pretended fierceness
by now. There were more men than ever to feed, since the
Glencoe MacDonalds and the Stewarts of Appin had
joined, and Kelpie was glad that they were in friendly
Cameron country, where it was safe to build fires and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
could have hot porridge. She had got heartily tired of a
diet of oatmeal mixed with cold water. She looked thoughtfully
up at Ben Nevis, which looked larger and more lowering
under its quilt of snow than in the green and tawny
blanket of summer, and realized suddenly that she had
had enough of army life.</p>

<p>Rab paused by the fire to sniff the oatmeal hungrily and
announce that he thought he would just go out and lift
some cattle for breakfast. He chucked Morag Mhor under
the chin as he said it, and received a sound clout on the
ear as a reward. “Ouch!” he exclaimed, making a great
show of nursing his ear. “You will ever be bullying me,
Morag <i lang="gd">avic</i>, and I a poor helpless man at your mercy.”</p>

<p>Kelpie giggled, and Morag shook her fist at the other
ear. “This is the day we go to ask Lochiel and the Camerons
to join us, and you would be lifting their cattle!
<i lang="gd">Amadan!</i>”</p>

<p>Rab began explaining that they didn’t really need the
Camerons at all, but Kelpie stopped listening, for she was
thinking that this would be a good time indeed to leave
the army. She had had enough of battles. Just a few miles
up the Great Glen was the pass that led to Glenfern.
Would she be welcome there? Surely Ian would remember
that she had warned him against Alex, and so would forgive
her for running away and leaving him struck down
and half dead. Would he and his father join Montrose?
she wondered. Or would Lochiel dare to raise his clan?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned to Morag Mhor, who had sent Rab, protesting,
out to the river for more water, and was now vigorously
stirring the porridge. “Lochiel would be daft to call
out his clan,” she suggested. “With his grandson in Campbell
hands, he could not dare.”</p>

<p>Morag thought about it for a while, her lean face still
and expressionless. “There was a wise woman in our village
long ago,” she said at last, “who used to say to me,
‘Always dare to do what is right,’ and I am thinking
Lochiel will say the same. Would you understand that,
Kelpie?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Kelpie forcefully and scowled. Ewen Cameron
himself had used those same words. So here again
were those ideas that she did not want to think about.
She set her small face into a hard mask and dropped the
subject. “I am thinking I have had my fill of armies and
battles,” she announced. “I will stay behind when you go
up the Great Glen, and perhaps go to stay with friends
here in Lochaber.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, and a blessing on you,” said Morag. “May
you find a home for your bones and your spirit—though
I think you will never stay in one place for long. I’m thinking
I’ll go back to Gordon country myself soon. No doubt
there are orphans left by the Campbells who would be
needing a mother.”</p>

<p>Kelpie followed the army as far as Lochiel’s home at
Torcastle, curious to see whether or not Lochiel would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
raise his clan. He did. The traditional cross was made of
two sturdy sticks bound firmly together. And according
to the ancient ceremony the ends were set aflame, extinguished
in goat’s blood, then lighted once more: one of
Lochiel’s men held the cross proudly high and set off
at a trot that carried him deeper into Cameron territory.
The torch would be passed from runner to runner until
the whole area had received the message of war.</p>

<p>The army stayed at Torcastle for two days while Camerons
came flocking to the call of their chief. If any had
misgivings about Argyll’s possible revenge on them, they
did not show it; nor did Lochiel, that stern old man who
held his head so high. Kelpie did not wait to see the
Glenfern Camerons arrive, for she had sudden misgivings
about seeing Ian again. Instead, she went back to the
tower room at Inverlochy Castle in a very thoughtful
frame of mind.</p>

<p>For several days she stayed at the castle, enjoying her
solitude, and getting her food from homes nearby with
surprising ease. For the very people who had once regarded
her with deep suspicion were now delighted to
give food and hospitality to the wistful lass who had been
a prisoner of Argyll, who had been helped by Ewen Cameron
himself, and who had even got away with Lady
Argyll’s fine cloak. Food, scanty though it might be with
the men away in the army, was shared, and there was not
a home where she was not urged to bide awhile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>But she shook her black head. Och, no, she said. She
was away up the Glen. But she would take her leave
marveling at such openheartedness to a stranger—even
one who had not yet stolen anything. After thinking about
it, Kelpie decided not to take anything at all. Somehow
the good will seemed more valuable than anything she
might steal.</p>

<p>Then the mild weather turned into sudden bitter cold.
The night wind hurled blasts of snow against the tower
walls, crept up the winding stairs, and whined outside like
the banshee. It was so cold that Kelpie thought she might
put away misgivings and go to Glenfern after all. Surely
Lady Glenfern would not refuse her shelter in this cold!</p>

<p>She was heading back to Inverlochy in the early dusk
when she decided this. Her stomach was comfortably full
of hot broth and scones from a generous young Cameron
wife, she was a trifle sleepy, and it would be good indeed
to sleep tomorrow night or the next in the comfort of
Glenfern, under the same roof with Wee Mairi.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that Kelpie’s senses remained alert even
when her mind was on other things. Even so, she had
nearly walked up to the castle gate before she realized
that something was wrong, and she never knew exactly
what it was that warned her. But suddenly she stopped,
alive to the sharp feel of danger, her small figure dark and
taut against the faintly luminous patches of snow. An
instant later she simply was not there, and the Campbell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
soldier who came running out of the gate, under the impression
that he had seen something, shook his head and
cursed the weather.</p>

<p>Kelpie lay in the snow where she had thrown herself
behind a small hillock, not daring to raise her head but
listening as if her life depended on it—which it did. Soon
there was no doubt. Inverlochy Castle was being occupied—by
Mac Cailein Mor and his army!</p>

<p>With sick dismay she pieced things together. Someone
called for Campbell of Auchinbreck. Then there was a
harsh and authoritative Lowland voice. And by crouching
behind a thick clump of juniper and twisting her head
cautiously, Kelpie could just make out a galley with black
sails silhouetted against the gray waters of the Loch.</p>

<p>Oh, there was no doubt whatever! The Campbell had
gathered his courage and his army and had come after
Montrose.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_19">19. Footprints in the Snow</h2>

<p>Kelpie spent the night at the shieling hut of Lorne
Cameron, which was nestled at the foot of Ben Nevis.
Lorne had urged Kelpie to stay, for she and her four bairns
were alone since her husband had gone off with Montrose
and his army. Now her ruddy young face paled at Kelpie’s
news.</p>

<p>“Campbells! <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> and they will be murdering us all,
then!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Kelpie hopefully. “If Mac Cailein
Mor is after Montrose, perhaps he’ll not be lingering in
Lochaber.”</p>

<p>But she slept with one ear well out of the folds of her
plaidie, cocked for any sounds of danger. The hut was
only a mile or so from Inverlochy Castle, and if Lorne had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
reason to fear Mac Cailein Mor, Kelpie had that much
more.</p>

<p>She had planned to be off the first thing in the morning,
out of danger. But somehow she found herself waiting,
even after she had eaten the hot oatmeal Lorne cooked,
and tucked some food into her pouch. There was Lorne
here, and the wee ones, and none of Kelpie’s concern at all.
But Lorne was frightened and uncertain what to do, and
they so helpless and looking up to Kelpie—and after all,
perhaps it would be wise just to take a wee peek at what
Argyll was doing, and see the size of his army.</p>

<p>“You might just be getting food and blankets together in
case you need to hide,” she suggested. “And I’ll go have a
look around.”</p>

<p>“Och,’tis both good and brave you are!” said Lorne
gratefully. Kelpie left the house hurriedly, feeling oddly
embarrassed.</p>

<p>She moved cautiously around the flank of the ben, skulking
behind masses of juniper and pine clumps, until she
could see the castle. <i lang="gd">Mise-an-dhui!</i> It was an army indeed
and indeed! Highland Campbells and Lowlanders too, and
well more than twice what Montrose could have, even
with his new recruits. But Argyll seemed to be making no
move to follow him up the Great Glen, even with this
advantage.</p>

<p>Kelpie’s heart sank as she watched groups of men forming
before the castle. It was what she had expected in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
heart of her. Mac Cailein Mor had no heart for battle but
would be about his usual practice of wiping out women
and children. Even now one of the groups of soldiers was
setting off toward the little cluster of homes on the edge
of Loch Linnhe, and another was turning west along Loch
Eil.</p>

<p>She watched no longer but headed back around the
northern side of Ben Nevis. In a way this might be fortunate
for her, giving her time to be up the Great Glen
ahead of them. But suppose they penetrated as far as
Glenfern? Perhaps she ought to be heading eastward, and
out of the way altogether. In any case she would be passing
Lorne’s home on the way, and it costing only a few
minutes to warn the lass. Nor was this just profitless foolishness,
she told herself, for who knew when she might be
needing a friend under obligation to herself?</p>

<p>An hour later she was laboring up the side of the mountain
with a bundle of food in one arm and the next-smallest
bairn in the other; Lorne, with the baby, and the
older children panting behind. “Mind ye stay clear of soft
snow,” she warned over her shoulder. “It could be putting
them on your trail.”</p>

<p>Another hour saw them settled in a well-hidden shepherd’s
shelter, cold and uncomfortable and not daring to
have a fire, but at least safer than at their home.</p>

<p>“Will you not be staying too?” begged Lorne, her dark
eyes anxious for the safety of this generous new friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
But Kelpie shook her head. She wanted to be farther than
this from Argyll. And besides, a new thought was beginning
to hound the fringes of her mind. Montrose, all unknowing,
was now between two armies, for was not Seaforth
at Inverness with five thousand men? And if he
should be caught in a trap and wiped out, it would put
Argyll altogether in control of the Highlands as well as
Lowlands—and what would happen to Kelpie then? For
her own safety, it seemed, she must try to warn Montrose.</p>

<p>It was a sore uncomfortable thought, filled with hardship
and danger. She tried to put it out of her mind as
she picked her way down the gaunt wintry slope, but it
wouldn’t leave. And with it were thoughts of Morag Mhor
and Rab and Archie and Montrose himself lying slain in
the snow, and all the comradeship and merry teasing silenced
forever. A pity that would be. With a sigh she
headed up the glen, a sharp eye out for any movement
that might spell danger.</p>

<p>Och, then, but it was cold! Her feet were icy in their
hide shoes, even with the woolen hose, and it was threatening
to snow again. However could she catch up with the
army at all? Perhaps it had already met Seaforth. But she
kept on going.</p>

<p>She saw nothing but hares and deer and a lone eagle,
until she reached the River Spean. Then a short, wiry
figure came from the brush just ahead, and Kelpie sank
swiftly to the ground for a tense moment before she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he was not a Campbell. He was alone and in a faded Cameron
kilt. Kelpie followed him to a dilapidated hut on the
bank of the river and watched him enter. A drift of smoke
began to rise. Might not he help himself and his clan by
taking the message for her? And then she would be free
to seek safety. She walked up to the door boldly.</p>

<p>“Come away in,” came the expected lilt of Gaelic when
she knocked, and the man’s face turned to her in surprise
as she entered. “<i lang="gd">Dhia dhuit</i>,” he greeted her politely. “And
what is a wee lass doing alone in the cold? Will you no
have a sup of hot food?”</p>

<p>“I will, then,” agreed Kelpie promptly. “And give an
important word to you, and also a task if you will do it.”</p>

<p>The man listened while she talked and ate, his face
growing graver and grimmer. “Aye so,” he agreed. “’Tis
the hand of destiny that I live alone here and knew nothing
of the clan rising, or I would be with them, and a bad
time of it you would be having alone and in this weather.
Eat your fill, then, whilst I fill my pouch, and I’ll be away
before you’re done. You can be biding here whilst I am
gone.”</p>

<p>“That I will not!” retorted Kelpie firmly. “For every
house in Lochaber is a danger. I’ll be away east out of
trouble.”</p>

<p>He frowned and shook his head. “There is no shelter to
the east of here, lass, and it too cold to be sleeping out.
And I have just come from hunting a wolf that has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
skulking upriver. You would be safer here, I am thinking,
for my house is alone and well hidden. But if you’re feared
to rest here, there is a bittie cave nearby, and you are
welcome to my blankets and food. Follow the Spean along
up for a mile or so, and where the Cour is entering it turn
south for a bit and mark sharp the west bank. The cave is
in a high bluff and well hid with juniper. But I’m thinking
you’ll be safe enough the night here, whatever, and it
nearly dark already. There’ll be no Campbells along this
day, and ’tis no good for you to be freezing.”</p>

<p>“Aye, then,” agreed Kelpie, seeing the sense to this, and
the man was off. Odd, she didn’t know the name of him,
nor he hers, and yet he was away on a dangerous errand
on her word. A purpose in common—or common danger—she
decided, was like a spell, binding even strangers one
to another.</p>

<p>The morning was heavy with clouds, the new snow a
dead white beneath the gray of the sky. Kelpie put out the
fire for fear of any betraying smoke and set out to locate
the cave, wishing she dared stay in the warmth of the
shieling. But as she trudged along the Cour River, watching
the west bank, she stopped. Clear in the snow were
footprints coming down the Cour—and stopping just
ahead in a tumbled heap of snow. Kelpie stared, eyes
narrowed. Footsteps didn’t just stop, unless someone had
wings.</p>

<p>No, there were no wings. There the prints went, back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the way they came. In a moment Kelpie had read the
story. A man it was, by the size of the prints, and coming
north along the Cour in a great hurry, so that he did not
notice the treacherous slab of granite by the river, with
ice under the snow. And there he had slipped and fallen;
the mark was plain. Then, it would seem, he had made
back the way he had come, limping sorely.</p>

<p>Kelpie straightened and looked up the glen cautiously.
Where was he, then? And who was he? Warily she began
to follow the retreating footprints.</p>

<p>They angled up the hill to the right presently, through a
thick patch of pine and juniper. Kelpie hesitated, peering
through it, her right hand reaching for the <i lang="gd">sgian dhu</i> in
the front of her dress, feet ready to run. Nothing stirred.
And then a tiny trickle of smoke floated up just a few feet
away from behind the brush. <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> It must be that he had
found the cave and taken shelter there. Probably he was
not a Campbell, then, but more likely hiding from them—though
he would not stay hidden long, with the smoke
giving him away. Kelpie grinned sourly and shrugged.
This was no place for her, then. She turned and prepared
to slip quietly away, back to the shieling.</p>

<p>“And have I taken the home of the water witch?”</p>

<p>It was a low voice with a mocking note that Kelpie
could never mistake. She whirled. Alex! She could see him
now through the brush, nearly invisible against the low
winter sun. He sat at the mouth of a small, shallow cave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
regarding her quizzically—but with a drawn look about
the mouth of him. One foot, badly swollen, was propped
up before him.</p>

<p>Och, then, wasn’t it her curse on him that had come at
last to bear fruit? Moving thru the juniper, but keeping a
safe distance away, Kelpie told him so with considerable
relish.</p>

<p>Alex grinned wryly. “It may be so,” he conceded. “Sure
it is you’ve cursed me enough. But have I not told you that
such things are likely to fly back in the face of the one
who curses? And if this is your curse at work, then ’tis not
just me you’ve harmed, but Montrose and his army, and
yourself as well. For Argyll is about, and I was on my way
up the Great Glen to warn Montrose when I fell; and what
will you do if Argyll wins and puts his witch-hunters over
the whole of the Highlands?”</p>

<p>His tone was still mocking, but Kelpie could hear bitterness
and despair in his voice. It made her feel most peculiar,
for Alex was usually so infuriatingly self-assured—and
much easier to hate that way. His distress was not quite as
satisfying as it should have been. For a moment she toyed
with the idea of leaving him to his worry, but she could
not resist bragging. She gave him a pointed grin.</p>

<p>“You will always be thinking yourself the only clever
body in the world,” she observed smugly. “I myself have
already sent a messenger to Montrose.”</p>

<p>Alex stared, frankly unbelieving. “You?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“And why not, whatever? Wasn’t I crossing Campbell
land myself with the army, and you away safe out of it?
Haven’t I the wits to see I’m not wanting Mac Cailein
Mor king in the Highlands? It is I should be doubting
you, for if Ian and his father are with Montrose now, I’m
thinking you’d not be going near whatever.”</p>

<p>Alex narrowed his hazel eyes at her, and Kelpie prudently
moved a step farther away. “And why not?” he
inquired lazily.</p>

<p>Kelpie laughed nastily. “I’ve eyes in my head!” she
retorted. “Did you think I was not seeing? Aye, and I saw
it before, as well, with the Second Sight, last spring.”</p>

<p>Alex’s eyes widened for an instant, then narrowed. He
seemed about to say something, but changed his mind.
Instead, the planes in his face became more angular than
ever, and he gave Kelpie a long, hard, brooding stare
that made her thankful for the hurt foot which kept him
from moving. For surely he was thinking that he would
like to silence her. He shrugged finally. “I wonder,” he
said, “whether ’tis the truth you’re telling me about that
messenger. If so, I could find it in my heart....”</p>

<p>He didn’t finish the thought, nor did Kelpie answer.
Instead, she stared back at him, at the freckles and straight
lines of his face, at the way the cheekbones stood out
above the narrow strength of jaw, and at the tangled red
hair which had not been trimmed or combed recently.
He was thinner than he had been and pale under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
freckles, and she could see a tiny pulse in his temple that
was his life itself—so easy to stop, so small a thread of
life. And was there not something she should be doing the
now, to avenge Ian? But she could not think what. Alex
was not asleep, nor by any means helpless, even with a
sore foot; and she had no intention at all of risking her
own life for Ian or anyone else. She pulled her thick
brows together and regarded him darkly.</p>

<p>Alex laughed suddenly. “You cannot be planning to rob
me, so it must be some other devilment you have in mind.
Are you not satisfied yet, water witch? Is it another wee
spell, or have you learned the Evil Eye by now?”</p>

<p>“Sssss!” said Kelpie earnestly.</p>

<p>“Well, and why will you not be going to Mac Cailein
Mor to say that I am here?” he asked. “He would make
short enough shrift of me, and would you not be liking
that?”</p>

<p>“Aye so,” agreed Kelpie with enthusiasm. “But,” she
pointed out regretfully, “he would be making even shorter
shrift of me, and I’d not be liking that so well.” And then
she bit her tongue in annoyance as Alex laughed again.
It was a spell he had put on her, to be always telling him
the truth she had never intended to say!</p>

<p>She scowled and lifted her lip in the old wolfish snarl,
and then found herself grinning ruefully, though she had
never intended that, either. It was not funny; it was <em>not</em>!
She stamped her foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ou, aye!” said Alex. “Your sense of humor has slipped
out again, and why will you be squashing it under? Laugh
at yourself, Kelpie. ’Tis the cure for all ills, and it is in
my mind that perhaps most evil is caused by folk who
take themselves too seriously.”</p>

<p>“You’re daft,” said Kelpie and turned away uncertainly.
She should be off about her business and leave Alex to his
fate. But it seemed that the thing inside that had been
pushing her for days against her will was pushing still.
It was as if she were living a pattern, and it was yet unfinished,
and the thing would not permit her to go off and
leave it until it was complete. She paused, her back turned
to Alex, who sat still and silent in the mouth of his refuge.</p>

<p>“What will you be doing now?” she asked against her
will.</p>

<p>“Bide here,” he returned philosophically, “since I can
do nothing else, and see what will happen.”</p>

<p>“They will be seeing your smoke,” she pointed out, still
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“I will let my fire die during the day, and try to keep
warm by moving about,” he returned, and the quizzical
note was back in his voice. “And why do you warn me of
that, water witch? Wouldn’t it please you just to see me
captured?”</p>

<p>“It would that!” Kelpie’s eyes flashed. “I will be laughing
that day, and not at myself either!” And this time she
did leave, heading angrily back toward the Spean River.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_20">20. The Campbell Lass</h2>

<p>Kelpie went back to the hut, since there was no other
shelter and it was better to risk Campbells than to
freeze to death. But she found a hiding place on the river
bank, just in case, and for three days she alternately
huddled over the tiny coals which were all she dared have
during the daytime and watched the path for signs of the
invaders.</p>

<p>There was plenty of time to think. She wondered
whether the message had got through to Montrose, and
what he could do even if it had. For he was trapped in
the Great Glen between two armies, and no way out except
over mountains impassable with snow. She wondered
about Alex and that long, inscrutable look he had given
her, and it came to her that she had been a fool to tell
him that she knew what he had done. For if he could
strike down his foster brother, it would be nothing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
him to silence her. She began to feel very trapped herself.
Was no place in the world safe for her?</p>

<p>Lost in brooding, she failed to keep her sharp watch,
and on the third afternoon she heard, too late, the crunch
of heavy steps in the crusted snow. Before she could do
more than turn, a heavy-set Campbell flung the door open,
two or three others looming behind him.</p>

<p>“Here’ll be another cursed Cameron or two,” he shouted,
and his broadsword bore grim stains from the last house
he had visited. “And where is your husband hiding, lass?”</p>

<p>Kelpie’s wits, well trained in crisis, worked quickly.
“Husband indeed!” she retorted, staring boldly into the
ruddy face. “Where are your eyes, man, that you cannot
recognize a Campbell when you see one?” She snatched
up Lady Argyll’s cloak and waved it at him, thankful for
that particular theft. “Och, but I am glad that you have
come,” she went on with a trusting upward smile through
her lashes. “It was my wicked Cameron uncle who came
by my home on Loch Awe with that devil Montrose and
all the army, and stole me away to keep house for him,
since his wife died, and he saying I must be his daughter
now and some day marry a Cameron; and have I not been
biding my time and waiting for warm weather to run away
back home?”</p>

<p>The Campbells blinked and believed her. She was
utterly convincing, and in any case, what Cameron would
have claimed to be a Campbell, even at the edge of death?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
And had she not the once fine Campbell cloak, clearly
given her by a lady of that clan? The sword went back into
its sheath.</p>

<p>“Och, well,” said its owner with a sigh. “Naught to do
here but burn the place. But at least you can be coming
back the now.”</p>

<p>This was the last thing Kelpie wanted! “To another
army?” she jeered, hiding her panic. “No, now, I’ve enough
of armies and battles. Leave me be, just, and when ’tis
warmer I’ll be finding my own way. Will you not be fighting
Montrose soon?” she demanded. “Or is it only women
and bairns you are after?”</p>

<p>They shuffled their feet. “We’ll be taking care of Montrose,”
promised the stout one. “But we cannot leave you
here, lass. You must just come along back to Inverlochy,
and perhaps himself will be seeing you’re sent back home.”</p>

<p>Kelpie’s heart threatened to choke her. He’d be sending
her back, fine enough! “<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>” she sputtered, knowing her
life might depend on her next words. “Will ye be bothering
the likes of him with a nobody, and him with a war on his
hands? He’d no be thanking ye for it! Besides,” she confided
beseechingly, “it is myself am afraid of Mac Cailein
Mor, and he so great and all. No, now, just leave me here,
and then it’s away back I’ll be by myself.”</p>

<p>The stout one was not unsympathetic. “Well, women
have daft fears,” he observed. “But ’tis true enough that
himself is an awesome man. We cannot leave you here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
but perhaps we can be tucking you into a wee bit place
near Inverlochy where you’ll not be noticed until we
move on. There is a burned shieling just near the loch,
with one end left untouched. Come along now.”</p>

<p>To argue further would be hopeless and perhaps fatal.
This was a stubborn man, already close enough to suspicion.
Numb with apprehension, Kelpie wrapped the cloak
firmly around herself and let them lead her outside while
they fired the thatch.</p>

<p>And then, just as they were climbing up the bank, a
tall man pointed to a faint wisp of smoke to the southeast.
“Another shieling,” he announced happily.</p>

<p>It was no shieling at all, of course. It was Alex’s fire,
and now Kelpie’s curse would be well and truly fulfilled.
Why hadn’t she thought of telling them herself? And why
was it that she felt more dismay than elation? Frowning,
she probed at the feeling, trying to figure it out. Och, of
course; It was not for Alex’s sake she did not want him
caught, but for her own. For he would be sure to tell
them that she was no Campbell at all but a gypsy lass,
and then they would take her straight to Argyll. She bit
her lip as she silently followed the Campbells up the Cour
in the direction of the telltale smoke, hoping passionately
that Alex would either get away or be killed before he
could betray her.</p>

<p>He nearly did get away. The cave, when they finally
found it, was empty, the fire quenched with snow. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
tangled footprints in the snow seemed to lead nowhere,
and they might have given up but for the stubbornness
of Hamish, the stout man. But at last someone saw Alex
hiding high up amid the dark needles of a pine tree.</p>

<p>“A MacDonald!” Hamish peered upward. “Come away
down, now, or we’ll shoot you there.”</p>

<p>“And what difference?” asked Alex mockingly from his
high perch. “I’d as lief be shot here as on the ground.”</p>

<p>Kelpie set her teeth. She hoped they’d shoot him now,
before he could see her and speak against her. She <em>did</em>!
But again Hamish had other ideas. What was a MacDonald
doing here at all, he wanted to know, and one, moreover,
who was clearly well educated and therefore at least the
son of a chieftain? It was a thing out of the ordinary and
had better have the attention of his own chieftain, Campbell
of Auchinbreck.</p>

<p>“We’re no for shooting you now,” he announced, “but
will be taking you prisoner.”</p>

<p>Alex seemed to think it over for a moment. Then he
laughed. “’Twill be a braw task for you, then,” he observed,
“for I’ve a sore hurt ankle and can no longer set
it to the ground—or else you’d not have found me here,
whatever. Are you wanting to carry me all that way? For
if not, you may as well shoot me here.”</p>

<p>This last clearly appealed to most of the Campbells,
but Hamish stuck out his jaw. “Aye, then. Finlay and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Angus will carry you,” he announced, to the displeasure
of two of his men.</p>

<p>Alex shrugged and came down, leaning for an instant
against the trunk of the tree as he reached the ground. His
face was cool, although his ankle must be hurting him
badly. But his lips tightened slightly when he saw Kelpie,
and he stood for an instant, fixing her with another of
those long, penetrating looks. There was more than
mockery in it now. Kelpie flinched from it, and it came to
her that Alex thought she had brought the Campbells to
find him.</p>

<p>Of course he did! How could he suppose anything else?
And he knew quite well that he held the power of vengeance
in his own tongue. For although he could not know
what was between Kelpie and Mac Cailein Mor, the mere
word “witch” would be quite enough to destroy her.</p>

<p>She waited for it, head high, with the look of a trapped
fox in her eyes, hoping they might kill her swiftly, for
Argyll would do worse. But Alex did not say it. Looking
into her eyes, he gave one short contemptuous laugh and
turned away. And while he arranged himself in the hand-chair
made by the reluctant Finlay and Angus, Kelpie
stood quite still, hot and shaken by feelings she hadn’t
known she possessed.</p>

<p>She tried to collect her thoughts during the long, slow
trip back to Inverlochy Castle. Why had Alex not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
denounced her? He must be waiting, knowing she would
be tormented by uncertainty. He would do it, doubtless,
when they reached the castle. Och, then, she must forget
the searing pain of his laughter, and try to get away!</p>

<p>Dusk was lowering as they neared Inverlochy, and she
sidled up to walk alongside Hamish. “I am frightened,”
she whispered pathetically. “There are too many men, and
I used to the lonely hills and cattle. Can I not just be slipping
away down the loch and home? I know the way well
enough.”</p>

<p>He looked at her kindly. “No, ’tis much too cold for
you to be traveling alone,” he said with firmness.</p>

<p>Kelpie’s lip trembled—and for this she required no
great dramatic ability, either. He looked alarmed. “Do not
be crying, now,” he said hastily. “I tell you, I know a place
where you can bide, and no need to be going among the
army at all. Just wait now until I’m turning the prisoner
over to Auchinbreck. Fergus, run ahead a bit and see can
you find out where he is the now.”</p>

<p>He clasped Kelpie’s cold hand firmly in his, no doubt
thinking he was comforting her; and Kelpie had to trudge
along beside him, her heart thudding with fear. It thudded
harder when Fergus returned to report that Auchinbreck
was away down at the loch with Mac Cailein Mor, seeing
about the two cannon.</p>

<p>“Fine, then,” said Hamish. “For the wee bit placie for
you to hide is down there too, and we need not be going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
near the castle at all but just deliver the prisoner and ask
can you stay there at the same time.” And he beamed
heartily upon the quaking Kelpie, who saw no escape now
from a witch’s death by fire.</p>

<p>Setting her teeth hard upon her lower lip, she tried to
remember that she had faced death before. But this time
she seemed to have no courage in reserve. The long strain
had drained it from her. She could only remember Mac
Cailein Mor’s cruel face and unbearable dungeon, and
think that this could not really be happening, and wish
that she could drop dead on the spot and be done with
it.</p>

<p>They were just past the castle now, and Hamish turned
to watch a scattered group of soldiers come running from
the slopes of Ben Nevis, cutting behind his group, in a
great hurry to reach the castle. There was an air of alarm
in their gray shapes in the dusk, and Hamish stared
after them curiously.</p>

<p>“A fine hurry they are in,” he said. “I wonder what news
it is they are bringing from the ben, and what they could
be finding at all on that wild place.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the water-bull of Lundavra has been straying
north a bit,” suggested Alex, breaking his long silence.
His voice dropped to an eerie whisper, and only Kelpie
could hear the hint of laughter in it. “You’ll have heard
of it, no doubt, with its broad ears and black hoofs and
wild demon eye?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldiers shivered, and one made a gesture, quickly
halted, of crossing himself. For though the Campbells
were now all good members of the Kirk, old habits remained
from many generations past and were likely to
pop up in a crisis.</p>

<p>They went on, with occasional furtive glances over
their shoulders at the brooding shape of that giant mountain
Ben Nevis—the highest, it was said, in all of the
British Isles, and therefore an apt place for uncanny and
ungodly things. Kelpie too would have been glad to scurry
from its menace, had there not been a greater one facing
her. As it was, she would gladly have fled to Ben Nevis for
protection, even if there were a dozen water-bulls there.</p>

<p>They had circled below the castle now, to the river, and
were perhaps a mile from Loch Linnhe. If only Hamish
would relax his hard, reassuring grip on her hand, she
might be able to dive into the surrounding dusk and lose
herself. But when she gently tested his grip, he merely
tightened it.</p>

<p>Perhaps if she should suggest to him that she could
walk better with both hands free? Or was it already too
late? There was a group of dark shapes in the gloom just
ahead now. If that was Argyll, this was her last chance!
“Please,” she began in her softest voice, and got no further.</p>

<p>From behind came the pound of running footsteps, and
an excited voice raised. “Mac Cailein Mor! Mac Cailein
Mor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>A soldier rushed past them to the figures a few yards
ahead, and the cold voice of Argyll answered. “Here.
What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“Montrose!” The soldier gasped. “Some of our scouts
have just come back. They say Montrose is on Ben Nevis!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_21">21. Vengeance</h2>

<p>In the shocked silence which followed, Hamish forgot
his comforting grip on the poor wee frightened lass for
an instant, and in that instant the poor wee frightened
lass vanished.</p>

<p>She crouched on the far side of a rhododendron bush,
tensed and ready for further flight. For the moment, it
was best not to move again, for there was silence beside
the river, and she dared make no noise that might call
attention to herself. Och, the good luck of it! And a fine
chance there was that, with this news, no one would think
of her again at all.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said Argyll. His voice was thin.</p>

<p>“It is true, Mac Cailein Mor!” insisted the messenger.
“On the north slope of Ben Nevis it was, his army ran
into our outpost, and some of our scouts escaped and
came to warn us.”</p>

<p>“Impossible,” repeated Argyll more thinly yet. “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
couldn’t. He went up the Great Glen, and he hasn’t come
back down it. And there’s no other way he could have
come in this cold and snow—not with an army and horses
and cannon. It’s not humanly possible.”</p>

<p>There was a good deal of sense in this. Even Kelpie,
still as a bogle behind her bush, frowned in puzzlement.
How <em>could</em> Montrose have come so quickly, and <em>not</em>
through the Great Glen? Over the bitter impassable mountains,
then? Och, Glen Roy, it must be! Argyll didn’t know
this country as she did, and as the Camerons and MacDonalds
would. Through Glen Roy, then—and it was
next to impossible even then, but if anyone at all could
do it, then it would be Montrose and his Highlanders, and
she the cause of it all, with her message! She hugged herself
silently.</p>

<p>“It couldna be the army,” said an Edinburgh voice
soothingly. “Gin ’tis Montrose at all, which I doot, ’tis a
mere handfu’ o’ wild Hieland thieves he could ha’ brought,
and we’ll wipe ’em oot the morn.”</p>

<p>“Still and all,” came another voice, “it might be best
for you to be going on board your galley, your Lordship.
You’ve an injured shoulder, remember, and you’re too
valuable to risk your life in a mere skirmish.”</p>

<p>“You may be right.” There was unmistakable relief in
Argyll’s voice, and Kelpie lifted her short lip in contempt.
“I can put you in charge, Auchinbreck, and send commands
from my galley. Who is that over there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>His voice rose sharply, and Kelpie’s hair stood on end
until she heard Hamish’s apologetic answer. “Hamish
Campbell, just, with a MacDonald I found skulking up
near the Spean River, and I thinking you might be wanting
to see him.”</p>

<p>“A MacDonald?” Auchinbreck’s voice was incisive. “Aye,
he’s likely a scout for Montrose and may be able to tell us
something. Will you speak to him, your Lordship?”</p>

<p>“Later,” said Argyll. “Take him down to the shelter by
the loch and stay there yourselves on guard. See that no
one goes near the galley, and I’ll question the prisoner
before I go board.”</p>

<p>There was a crunch of snow as Argyll and his party
started back toward the castle, and then a pause. “Why
isn’t he tied?” came Argyll’s voice accusingly.</p>

<p>“Och, your Lordship, he has a hurt foot, and it would
be too hard to carry him this whole way if—”</p>

<p>“He could have been shamming, you fool!” Argyll was
furious. “Tie him now.”</p>

<p>He went on, leaving the other group of dark shapes
where they stood. “Well, so, and himself was saying ‘now,’”
muttered Hamish, “so now it is, my lad. We’ll have your
two hands behind you. <em>Were</em> you shamming?”</p>

<p>“Not a whit,” said Alex coolly. “I’d have left you before
this, if I were.”</p>

<p>“Well, I almost have it in my heart to pity you, just for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
your courage, though you’re a cursed MacDonald. Angus,
where’s the wee lass?”</p>

<p>“She was off and away at the word Montrose,” reported
Angus, “and no wonder. She’s frighted even of our army
and will be in terror of his. She’ll no be staying for a battle.”</p>

<p>“Och, she’ll freeze, just, poor <i lang="gd">amadain</i>!” said Hamish
worriedly. “And she could have been staying at the shelter
with us, and quite safe. Well, so. Come away now.”</p>

<p>They moved off toward the loch, leaving Kelpie to figure
out her new situation.</p>

<p>It was a great improvement, surely, but hardly rosy. If
only the weather were warm, there would be no problem
at all. She could set off for safety, leaving Alex just where
she wanted him, and Montrose over behind the mountain
to settle with Argyll after Argyll had settled with Alex.
But it was cold! And there would be no shelter near, what
with all the homes burned. And she didn’t want to freeze.</p>

<p>An hour earlier she would gladly have taken the chance,
gladly frozen, even, in preference to meeting Argyll.
But now that she was out of danger from him for the moment,
she wanted to live, and how could she be arranging
it? If it were not for Alex, she might slip down to the
shelter after all, and just hide when Argyll came. But
Alex would not miss another chance to betray her. He
had delayed too long once before, and he must be cursing
himself for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>But she had to do something! Shivering, she got to her
feet and silently followed an orange glimmer down near
the loch. Och, a fire! Kelpie hurried her steps until she
could see the ruins of a shieling hut, one side open to
the night, but with a warm fire just at the edge, where the
fireplace had once stood. Alex, well bound now, was lying
against one wall, and the other men were grouped around.
As she watched, they began taking food from their
pouches.</p>

<p>In an agony of indecision, Kelpie crouched in the
bushes, just too far away to feel the warmth of the fire,
but she didn’t dare to go closer. She could almost wish
Alex free, so that—</p>

<p>Her eyes widened. Alex had turned over to face the
wall and was unmistakably settling down to sleep! How
could he? Reluctantly Kelpie admired him for it. He was
a bad one, but for all that he had a cool courage that was
fine.</p>

<p>She waited a few minutes more; then she <em>had</em> to get
warm! And Alex seemed to be truly asleep. Standing up,
she raised her voice scarcely above a whisper. “Hamish!”</p>

<p>He was up, his ruddy face turning to search the bushes.
“The wee lass! Are you frozen, just? Come away to the
fire. It was gey foolish of you to run off.”</p>

<p>She came, rubbing her numbed hands in the heavenly
warmth, even though it made them hurt sorely. “I was affrighted,”
she explained, “of Montrose, and of all the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and of Mac Cailen Mor, and even of him.” She nodded
toward Alex. “Please, if anyone comes, could I not be
hiding away at the back behind the walls until they go?”</p>

<p>“Ou, aye,” said Hamish tolerantly, “if you’re so frighted
as all that.”</p>

<p class="tb">It was nearly morning, and Kelpie had napped a little
herself and was warm and fed (with a wary eye on the
sleeping Alex), before voices and steps announced a party
coming from the castle. In a flash she was around behind
the ruined shieling, just at the corner where she could
hear everything and even see a bit. She would be safe
enough from now on, for although it was still dark enough
to escape, the faintest of gray appeared over the stern
dome of Ben Nevis, and the peaks farther south were beginning
to show starkly black against the lighter clouds.
The night was over, and she could afford to stay and
watch what happened to Alex.</p>

<p>“Put my things aboard,” ordered Argyll’s cold voice.
“I’ll be along as soon as I see to this prisoner. Where is
he?”</p>

<p>“Here, asleep,” replied Hamish humbly. “Wake you up,
MacDonald! Mac Cailein Mor wants to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Apparently Alex awoke as Kelpie always did, all at
once, for there was no trace of sleepiness in his voice.
“Well, then, and let us talk,” he returned casually.</p>

<p>Kelpie knew that his coolness would enrage Argyll, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
repeatedly fled danger and was about to do it again. This
would go hard with Alex. She <em>must</em> see! There was a hole
in the wall, just at the corner, where a stone had fallen
out, and surely no one would be noticing a wee eye in the
dark!</p>

<p>She applied the eye to the hole. Sure enough, Argyll’s
pale face was twisted with anger, the habitual sneer
deeper than usual. And Alex had that faintly amused
smile on his face, despite bound hands and swollen foot,
and despite his fear.</p>

<p>“Your name?” asked Argyll harshly.</p>

<p>“Alexander MacDonald of Ardochy on Loch Garry,” replied
Alex proudly.</p>

<p>“So. Son of a chieftain, then. And what were you doing
skulking in Lochaber?”</p>

<p>“Nursing a sprained ankle,” replied Alex, still with a
faint smile, “and hoping to be overlooked by your men.”</p>

<p>“You knew we were here, then?” Argyll pounced upon
the idea like a man looking for an excuse to unleash a
storm of venom. And there was no doubt he had his victim.
Kelpie’s revenge would be better than she had ever
dreamed! She pressed closer to her peephole to see if Alex’s
face would betray fear. But he just lifted a sandy eyebrow.</p>

<p>“Could anyone <em>not</em> be knowing you were here, with the
smoke of burning homes rising like the plague?” he retorted
reasonably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are one of Montrose’s men!” Argyll said accusingly,
and Kelpie found herself thinking of the things Alex
might answer to that. He would never claim to be a Covenanter,
proud fool that he was, but he could say he was
not with Montrose, that he never had been, that he had
had a quarrel with the Camerons—any number of things.
But he said none of them. Did he not know that his silence
would seem an admission of guilt? Kelpie fumed at his
stupidity before she remembered that—this time—she was
on Argyll’s side.</p>

<p>“You are a spy left behind!” Argyll went on threateningly.
“It was you warned him we were here!”</p>

<p>“I wish I <em>had</em> been the one,” confessed Alex wryly. “I
would not be here if I had. But since I <em>am</em> here, and not
with Montrose, that is clearly nonsense.”</p>

<p>“Don’t quibble with me!” Argyll was in a cold rage, the
cruel, bullying streak in him showing clear. “You were responsible.
You hurt your foot and sent someone else with
the message.”</p>

<p>In the gleam of the fire, Alex’s jaw moved up and outward
a fraction. “I would have done so,” he retorted
proudly, “but that I could find no one to send.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not save your life that way.” There was wintry
satisfaction in Argyll’s face. “Unless you can produce the
guilty party and prove your innocence ...” The sentence
went grimly unfinished.</p>

<p>Even Hamish looked shocked at this unfairness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for an instant Kelpie missed the full irony of the situation.
Then it dawned on her. Alex was to die for the thing she
herself had done—and he well aware of it and helpless,
since he had no notion where she was! It was almost too
good to be possible!</p>

<p>She bit her lip and pressed closer to the chink, and a
squeak of what must be delight—although it felt almost
like a sob—escaped her.</p>

<p>Alex turned—oh, so casually!—and his eyes, dark in the
shadow of the shelter, looked straight into hers.</p>

<p>Kelpie stopped breathing. Too appalled even to move,
she stood frozen, waiting for the simple, deadly words
that must come next. In her mind she heard them clearly.
“Very well so, and you will find the guilty party is the
witch lass hiding this very moment outside the wall....”
She should be away, running like a hare! But she could
not, for her shock had glued her feet to the ground, and
already Alex had begun to speak.</p>

<p>“And how,” he asked deliberately, “could I be doing
that?”</p>

<p>Kelpie missed the next part of the conversation, for she
was altogether stunned. He had seen and recognized her;
never a doubt of it. In that instant she had handed him
the victory, his own life and hers as well, and he had
dropped them indifferently at his feet! Why? Was he fey,
then, to be deliberately throwing away his life? Not even
the scruples of Ian could account for it, for Alex owed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
nothing and less than nothing, especially since he believed
she had betrayed him to the Campbells.</p>

<p>In her bewilderment she didn’t even feel relief at her
own narrow escape. And when she was again able to concentrate
on the scene inside, she found that Alex had
taken the edge off her victory simply by giving it to her.
Where had the triumph and savor gone? Frowning, she
reminded herself that Alex was being justly punished for
what he did to Ian, and she was <em>not</em> sorry! No, nor would
she ever dream of wanting to save him whatever, for he
deserved to die, and had she not been planning revenge?
She would not <em>want</em> to help him even if she could—and
couldn’t if she wanted to, for was it not her rule of life to
look out for herself and no one else? And if Mac Cailein
Mor should so much as glimpse the witch lass caught trying
to hex him, and herself wearing his own wife’s gown
and cloak this moment.... She laughed at herself for
even thinking that such a daft idea could ever enter her
head. It was gloating she was. She <em>was</em>!</p>

<p>Intent on her gloating, she risked another peep through
the chink and saw that Argyll was biting his lip with anger.
Alex had no doubt just said something derisive, for
he was smiling recklessly. But for all his composure, Kelpie
knew that he was afraid in the face of death. Had not she
herself, more than once, acted calm when she did not feel
that way? Och, she knew how his heart must be pounding,
as her own was just from imagining it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Or perhaps it was pounding with happiness and excitement
and triumph. Her fists were clenched painfully and
her lips drawn back from her teeth. This was the moment,
and she would watch while—while—</p>

<p>“Take him out yonder and shoot him,” said Argyll.</p>

<p>Then Kelpie heard a reckless laugh coming from her
own lips, and she found herself around the wall and in the
firelight and confronting Argyll with her head held high.</p>

<p>“No, now,” she said, “for ’twas I sent the messenger.”</p>

<p>One part of her stood aghast and terrified at the insane
thing she had done, but the other part—the thing inside,
which had been pushing her for so long—was glad and
triumphant.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Chapter_22">22. The Last Word</h2>

<p>For a moment even the daybreak seemed to pause over
the Highlands. The thin sky of morning lighted a wan
world of muted gray and white and purple with an eerie,
ghostlike tone. There was no sound outside the ruined
shelter with its circle of sickly firelight, and for just an
instant there was no sound even there.</p>

<p>Alex’s face seemed carved in an odd expression of exultation
and anguish combined, and his eyes fixed upon
her as if they would never leave. But Kelpie did not see
this, for her own eyes were fixed defiantly upon Argyll,
waiting.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait. “The witch!” he whispered,
and his eyes blazed in pale fury. “And in her Ladyship’s
stolen clothes!” he added with new outrage.</p>

<p>Alex laughed, and his laughter was delighted, exasperated—and
somehow sad. He moved to stand beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Kelpie. “Och,” he said, “and isn’t it just the way you
will be overdoing things? I would have had you remain
unprincipled and live. I would have called you liar and
saved you yet. But you must appear in Lady Argyll’s
stolen clothes and seal your doom—and knowing it!” His
eyes were stricken, exultant, tender; but Kelpie only
looked at him dazedly. All of it was beyond her understanding,
except that she had doomed herself irrevocably
by her own madness, and the thing inside said it must be
so.</p>

<p>Argyll was breathing hard, taut with hatred; his menace
was overwhelming. “Shoot the man now,” he said between
his teeth, “but bind the witch and take her aboard the
galley. I will try her and burn her when this business with
Montrose is over.”</p>

<p>And then all Lochaber seemed to explode at once. Shots
echoed from Ben Nevis just as Alex went quite berserk.
His face was as she had seen it in the witch-hunting town,
jutted with sharp angles of rage. He hurled himself against
Argyll, the full force of his hard shoulder driving into the
Campbell’s midsection; and down they went. The others
rushed forward with yells, and from the castle came more
yells and a new volley of shots.</p>

<p>Hamish was pulling his chief from under Alex and
shouting, “The battle has started!” Someone kicked Alex
brutally in the head, and Kelpie flung herself at the culprit,
using both teeth and nails, and was herself flung to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
ground, while still another voice shouted, “Get you to the
galley, Mac Cailein Mor!”</p>

<p>Kelpie, dazed from her fall, saw Argyll, staggering and
winded, clutching his shoulder and croaking contradictions.
“Shoot them! Take the witch on board! I’ll burn
them both! Shoot them at once!” Alex struggled up and
tried to shield Kelpie with his own body as someone raised
a gun. She heard a wild shriek of pipes from the direction
of Ben Nevis, more shots and more yells. And then came a
blaze of pain, and nothing at all.</p>

<p class="tb">She lay for a while without opening her eyes, trying to
decide whether she was really alive. It seemed quite unlikely.
But on the other hand, except for a sore pain in
her head and a hot, smoldering one in her body, this did
not seem like Hell. For one thing, she seemed to be in a
soft bed with sheets, and surely Hell would never provide
such things. She decided to open her eyes and find out.</p>

<p>Opening her eyes did not help much, but only added to
her confusion. For was not this one of the bedrooms at
Glenfern, which she had helped often enough to clean?
And whatever could she be doing here at all? Clearly she
could not be here—but how was it that a stout and smiling
Marsali seemed to be feeding her beef broth? Och, it
was too much effort to worry about it! She swallowed the
broth, closed her eyes, and slept again. The next time she
awoke, it was to morning light, and she felt much stronger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a small movement to the left of the bed, and
Kelpie slowly focused her eyes toward it. A flower face
lighted and moved closer. “Och, my Kelpie!” whispered
Wee Mairi, radiant. “You’ve come away back to me!”</p>

<p>Hot tears stung Kelpie’s eyes. She closed them and
moved her left hand gropingly and felt a small warm one
creep into it. Och, the wee love! The tears slid down her
cheeks.</p>

<p>There was more movement presently, and then Ronald’s
voice asking with deep interest, “Is she awake yet?”</p>

<p>“Of course she is, or how else could she be weeping?”
demanded his twin scornfully. “Kelpie, is it hurting you
are? Can you open your eyes, Kelpie? Fiona, will you run
to tell Mother she is awake?”</p>

<p>Kelpie opened her eyes mistily and saw the rosy, concerned
faces over her. Fiona, crossing herself as usual, appeared
beyond them and then disappeared again. Donald
vanished too, while Kelpie—still gripping Wee Mairi’s
hand—closed her eyes again and tried to sort out the confusion
of her thoughts. Presently there was a slight denting
of the bed near her elbow.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought Dubh,” announced Donald cheerfully.
“We decided before that you were not a witch, but now
Alex says you are, but a nice one; and I was thinking, if
Dubh is still liking you, perhaps Alex is right.”</p>

<p>Kelpie wrinkled her forehead as Dubh spat nastily at
Donald. Alex? Alex at Glenfern? Dubh regarded her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
slitted yellow eyes and then draped himself in a scraggy,
purring fur piece across her shoulder. “Alex?” said Kelpie
aloud, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Ou, aye, and he sore hurt, too.” Ronald nodded. “But
he is better now. Kelpie, when you are well, will you tell
us about your adventures? Why were you leaving Glenfern
at all, Kelpie? Do you <em>like</em> your Grannie Witchie, or
was it that you were afraid of her, as Father said? Is she
truly a witch, Kelpie? Where is she the now? Are you going
to stay with us? Wee Mairi says you love her. Do you,
Kelpie?”</p>

<p>The small hand in Kelpie’s stirred. “Aye so!” piped Wee
Mairi indignantly. “My Kelpie <em>does</em> love me!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” confessed Kelpie, her defenses quite down.
“But,” she went on incredulously, “is Alex truly here? At
Glenfern?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Donald. “He has been telling us of his
adventures too, and how Montrose was sending him on a
special important mission to talk to clan chiefs and see if
Lochiel would join the army, and all; and that was why
he was alone and caught by the Campbells. But we do not
know why you were there at all.” He paused, head tilted
hopefully to one side.</p>

<p>But Kelpie, more and more bewildered, was in no state
to tell stories. “Alex?” she repeated stupidly.</p>

<p>“Himself.” It was his voice, with something new in the
laughter of it. Suddenly the room was full of people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Eithne and Lady Glenfern smiled at her from the foot of
the bed, and Alex himself was coming slowly across the
floor. There was a bandage round his head, and he leaned
heavily on Glenfern and Ian.</p>

<p>Och, it made no sense at all! Kelpie closed her eyes
again and moved her head fretfully.</p>

<p>“Alex has told us what you did,” said Glenfern. “It is at
such times that a person’s true character comes forth.” He
smiled down at her warmly. “Let you know now, Kelpie,
that you will always have a home at Glenfern, and our
love; and for saving Alex we owe you a debt that we can
never pay.”</p>

<p>Kelpie’s puzzlement deepened. <i lang="gd">Dhé!</i> It must be that
Ian had never known that it was Alex who struck him
down! In the confusion, perhaps herself was the only one
who had really seen it. It must be so, for no other explanation
made sense. Perhaps Archie hadn’t known either,
and she had merely read meanings into his words that
evening in the camp. Her blue eyes flew open and met
Alex’s quizzical ones. What an actor he was, then, behaving
as if nothing had happened! But <em>she</em> could tell them
what had happened, and Alex knew it, and yet here he
stood quite at ease.</p>

<p>They stared at each other for a long, searching moment,
and a look of baffled frustration came to both faces. And
then Kelpie closed her eyes once again, too weak to cope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
with such a puzzle or even to decide whether or no she
should tell Ian what his foster brother had done.</p>

<p>“<i lang="gd">Dhé</i>, and she’ll be confused enough, poor water witch!”
The old teasing note in Alex’s voice overlaid a new tenderness.
“Just be settling me in a chair by the bed, and then
away out, the rest of you, whilst I tell her the end of our
adventure.”</p>

<p>Presently the room was silent again, except for Dubh’s
purring. Conscious of a presence beside the bed, Kelpie
opened a cautious eye again after a minute and found the
hazel eyes fixed on her broodingly.</p>

<p>“Och so,” he murmured, shaking his head sadly. “I had
thought my cousin Cecily unpredictable and you an open
book, with your devious wiles, and so candidly unprincipled.
And then—you put a spell on me, with the ringed
witch-eyes in your head. You baffled me, you haunted me,
you eluded me, leaving me forever two jumps behind and
never knowing what to think at all. Aye me, I suppose I
shall never understand you at all, and that is my fate and
destiny.”</p>

<p>Kelpie slowly progressed from bewilderment to indignation.
Only the last words had any meaning whatever, and
that was little enough.</p>

<p>“<em>I!</em>” she fumed, causing Dubh to dig in a protesting
claw. “It is you who make no sense at all, and I never
knowing what to think!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Alex grinned ruefully. “At least we are even, then. Are
you wanting to know what has happened since Argyll’s
men put bullets in the both of us?”</p>

<p>Kelpie nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, then, were you hearing the start of the battle,
just as our own wee war was getting exciting?” asked Alex.
She nodded again, content to lie still and listen. “Well,”
he went on, “it was the battle that saved us, for Argyll
rushed off to the safety of his galley, and his men left us
for dead—and very nearly right they were. And so we
lay unknowing while Montrose won a great victory over
an army twice his size. It was another Tippermuir, and
this time the fighting force of the Campbells is crippled
for years to come. Some say as many as fifteen hundred
were slain, and the rest taken prisoner or chased back to
their own country, and our men on their heels all the way
to Lundavra. I think it will be another generation, Kelpie,
before Clan Campbell can come raiding other clans again—and
a good blow for the King’s cause as well,” he added,
almost as an afterthought. Loyal to the king though he
was, Alex was a Highlander, and Highland affairs were
his closest concern.</p>

<p>Kelpie found herself wondering suddenly about Morag
Mhor and Rab, Archie, and the others. “And had we many
killed?”</p>

<p>Alex shook his head. “It was a rout,” he said. “They tell
me there are some two hundred or more wounded, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
scarce over a dozen killed outright. It seems fair unbelievable.”</p>

<p>Kelpie assimilated this and then returned to another
matter of interest. “What of Mac Cailein Mor?” she demanded
vindictively. “And what was happening to us,
after all?”</p>

<p>“Och, the great General Campbell was away down the
loch in his galley before the fight was yet over, hero that
he is!” Scorn was bright in Alex’s voice. “But as for us,
we lay until some of our men found us and recognized my
tartan, so they took us up to the castle with the other
wounded. There were plenty of the army who knew me—and
you, too, it seems, for there was a hulking great
man named Rab and a huge fierce woman called Morag
Mhor nearly come to blows over which could be doing
most for you.” His eyes crinkled at her with approval and
amusement. “So it was soon enough that my brother and
Ian both found us. And when we were fit to be carried,
they brought us here.”</p>

<p>“Here!” echoed Kelpie, renewed bafflement upon her.
Forgetting her wounds, she tried to sit up and then
changed her mind. Wincing, she lay back again, and her
ringed eyes stared beneath lowered brows at Alex. Dubh,
his nap disturbed, glared with equal fierceness, and Alex
found the combination disconcerting.</p>

<p>“You would be coming <em>here</em>?” Kelpie spat. “You, with
all your prating of loyalty and the laws of hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and this principles thing? And you have not even good
sense, for here am I, and whatever makes you think I
will not be telling? And yet you have not even tried to
threaten me.”</p>

<p>Complete bewilderment was on Alex’s face. “Either
your wits or mine are wandering entirely,” he said. “What
are you talking about? Tell what?”</p>

<p>“That you tried to kill Ian!” answered Kelpie.</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” He was utterly dumfounded, and Kelpie’s
conviction wavered, but only briefly. She knew what she
had seen!</p>

<p>“Do not be denying it, for I saw it myself, and twice
over—once with the Second Sight, which never lies, and
again when it happened.”</p>

<p>Alex’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, as if he had begun
to see a clue to some deep puzzle. “You were saying something
of the sort back at yon cave,” he said. “It made
no sense, but I had already given up expecting to understand
you, and there were other urgent matters on my
mind. Tell me now: What was it that you saw twice over?
Tell me exactly, for although the Second Sight never lies,
sometimes the reading of it can be wrong. What was it
you were seeing, water witch?”</p>

<p>Kelpie frowned. “It was the crowd of witch-hunters,
although the first time I did not know who or where, or
that it was me they were going to burn. But I saw Ian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
coming through them, and you after him with a black
anger on your face. And when you reached him, you
raised your sword and brought it down on him, and he
dropped like a stone and out of sight.” She glared at him
defiantly.</p>

<p>A whole series of expressions chased one another across
Alex’s face, but they were not quite the ones Kelpie had
expected. Wonder and relief and joy surely had no place
there!</p>

<p>“My sorrow,” he whispered, closing his eyes for an
instant. “And is it for that you’ve hated me so darkly this
long while? No wonder!” He looked at her suddenly with
new delight. “And for Ian too, though you tried so hard
to admit no loyalty or friendship, and I believed you!
Think carefully,” he commanded as Kelpie was about to
burst out at him in frustration and fury. “Were you actually
<em>seeing</em> my sword <em>strike</em> Ian?”</p>

<p>“Aye so—” began Kelpie hotly, and then paused. “Well,
and there was a head in the way for a wee moment,” she
conceded, conjuring up the vivid picture and looking at
it carefully. “Your sword is striking him just behind the
head—the other head, I mean—but now Ian is falling
straight away, and so—”</p>

<p>“Look again!” interrupted Alex. “Look closely, Kelpie,
and do not judge too quickly. For my sword was falling
on the man who was in the act of dirking Ian, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
went down at the same moment. Little <i lang="gd">amadain</i>, how could
you be thinking I would turn on my foster brother, dearer
than kin, for whom I would give my heart’s blood?”</p>

<p>Kelpie scowled in sudden, unreasoning resentment, but
he leaned forward to place his hand on her arm where it
lay outside the covers. “Look in your heart for the truth,”
he commanded urgently. “Ask it of your reason as well.
You <em>must</em> know that I did not do it.”</p>

<p>It was true. She did know it. She felt slightly dizzy, as
if the sun had spun round suddenly and begun rising in
the west. And was it a mistake that she had hated Alex
this long time? Och, no! Had he not always infuriated her
with his mockery and scorn and his uncanny knowledge
of what she would think and do next? But whatever had
possessed the both of them that dawn in the shelter, each
offering his own life to save the other? She could hardly
believe that it had really happened.</p>

<p>The eyes she raised to Alex were night-blue with wonder.
“You knew I was hiding behind the wall! Why didn’t
you save yourself by telling Mac Cailein Mor it was I sent
the message? And especially when you thought that I had
betrayed you to the Campbells? <em>Why?</em>”</p>

<p>There was sudden gladness on Alex’s lean face. “Kelpie!”
he fairly shouted. “You didn’t betray me, then?”</p>

<p>She shook her head irritably and immediately wished
she hadn’t. “I <em>told</em> you I did not dare! And now you know
why, with Mac Cailein Mor already wanting me for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
witch, and I with his wife’s clothing on my back. ’Twas
the smoke from your fire betrayed you, fool that you were!”
She glared at him. “But you were <em>believing</em> it was I, and
you needing only a word to save yourself and settle all
accounts. Why did you not tell?” she demanded angrily.</p>

<p>Alex grinned flippantly at her, but the angles of his face
seemed softened, and his voice as well. He seemed to be
laughing at her and at himself too. “Perhaps, <i lang="gd">mo chridhe</i>,
it was for the same reason that you spoke out when you
needed only to stay still. Can you answer me your own
question, Kelpie? Why did you come forth?”</p>

<p>“I was daft, just!” she retorted promptly. “And,” she
added, remembering, “there was a thing in me pushing
where I was not wanting to go.” She frowned.</p>

<p>“There has been a thing in me too, this long while,” said
Alex softly, and for an instant he saw her as she had appeared
from the shadows to face Argyll—intense then too,
but heartbreakingly brave, nearly tearing him apart with
joy for her gallantry and with despair for its result. And
he had not known, then, the full horror of what she was
facing, that she was giving herself up to be burned as a
witch.</p>

<p>She was regarding him with annoyance. “I think it was
a spell, whatever,” she announced accusingly.</p>

<p>Alex looked at her oddly. “Aye so, a spell,” he muttered
with a wry twist to his mouth. “And I with a fondness for
merry, fair-haired lassies, like my sweet Cecily in Oxford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
And now she will have to marry Ian, just, though perhaps
neither of them will mind much. I have <em>never</em> cared for
witches!” he told her plaintively. “And especially not
black-haired ones, with dark, pointy faces, all uncanny
eyes. It’s never a moment’s peace I shall have again; but
’tis a terrible, strong spell you have put on me, and I cannot
break it. Och, there’s no way at all out of it, but I
shall have to marry you, just!”</p>

<p>“Marry me!” Kelpie’s shock reached to the very soles
of her feet.</p>

<p>“Ou, aye,” answered the outrageous lad, wagging his
head sadly. “And a dreadful life it will be, never a doubt
of it, wed to a wild wee water witch. But marry you I
must, for I cannot help myself.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> can, then!” Kelpie sizzled with outrage. “Did you
never think of consulting <em>me</em>? Were you thinking I would—<i lang="gd">Dhé!</i>
I’d sooner be wedding the sea horse in Loch Ness,
or Argyll himself! And the very conceit of you to be thinking
it! ’Tis a spell indeed I’ll be putting on you! Wait until
I learn the Evil Eye, and then see will you not be begging
my mercy, and with the horrid spots all over you, and—”</p>

<p>Alex silenced her by the simple expedient of putting his
lips firmly over hers. When at last he lifted them, it was
to laugh into her startled and indignant eyes with the old
mockery.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking,” he said, just as if she had never uttered
a word of her last speech, “that I shall have to be taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
you out of Scotland altogether, or sooner or later it would
be to the stake with the both of us. And in any case, what
else could I be doing with the gypsy wanderlust in your
feet?”</p>

<p>“The gypsies <em>stole</em> me, I tell you!” retorted Kelpie automatically.</p>

<p>He raised a quizzical eyebrow. “And did they so, truly?
Well, and what does it matter? You could never be finding
your parents now, nor fit into their life if you did. And in
any case, you’re going to marry me, and we’ll away to the
New World. A grand wilderness it is, they say, with all
the space needed for wandering in and out of trouble.”</p>

<p>He bent toward her again, and reached for her hand,
as Kelpie opened a mutinous mouth. Dubh, who had
patiently endured the last disturbance of his nap, opened
one yellow eye, saw Alex’s hand approaching, and slashed
it. Then he rearranged himself across Kelpie’s neck and
went back to sleep.</p>

<p>Kelpie laughed at Alex, who was also laughing and
sucking at his torn finger. “You see?” he said. “The Red
Indians and wild animals will never have a chance against
you with your dark power over man and beast, witch that
you are. I wonder, would next week be too soon for the
wedding?”</p>

<p>“Sssss!” said Kelpie contentedly.</p>
